The brain is a black box, its operations hidden and dark.  Through science we
analyze it and open its mechanism to the light; through disputation arenas and
government competition we replace the brain with openly designed decision
mechanisms.  The brain is not trustworthy, which is why we have moved away
from monarchies; governments are not trustworthy, which is why we have moved
away from traditional land-based countries.  We started as a community of
rationalists on a ship with no home port, headed by rationalism masters,
Senseis, as we half-jokingly called them.  We grew into a loose-knit network
of sea platforms, exporting knowledge and culture, importing food and physical
necessities.

Our vital mistake was to forget that power begets more power.  And to forget
that conflict inevitably blossoms when a new power begins to rise just enough
to potentially challenge an old power.

All it took was the most powerful land-based country to get an egotistical
head of state, in a travesty of disputation arenas called an "election".

The tension between government and individual can be seen, writ large enough
to see, in the tension between governmental environmentalism and corporate
interest.

Each sea platform inevitably pollutes; the question is how much pollution is
acceptable.  In a continuously flowing and changing medium, where does one
individual's rights end and another's begin?

It is this insight that reveals that government is not some faceless entity
that serves only to consume resources by taxation.  Instead, it is the proxy
for each and every other individual -- each individual who is not the
individual being taxed.  Government does not fail by existing; it fails
solely if it fails to uphold the interests of those it represents.

R1 - Stable government, maintenance version
- Has Seedling concept (teenagers at the cusp of adulthood (15-16)
  are put on a cruise ship (built by R1 and R2) to learn more and
  experience life in other governments of Sea State, and to find
  their niche)
R2 - Unstable government, mainline development
- Based on R1 laws

Dunbarites - Stable government
- Sea platforms split upon reaching 150 individuals (Dunbar's number)

Strength through diversity
Diversity through tolerance
Tolerance through understanding
Understanding through rationality
