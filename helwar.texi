@node The End of Childhood
@chapter The End of Childhood

Only three of their parents would be able to attend
the Seedling initiation of
Marco de Alugbati and Stephanie de Alugbati.
One of their fathers, Redemptor Alugbati or Daddy Red,
was currently assigned to the sea fertilization pumps.
Redemptor had offered to pull some strings
to swap his assigned shift ---
the family had quite a bit of influence, after all,
given the family business ---
but this was overruled by the other adults in the family.
The four Alugbati parents took pride in public service.

Marco de Alugbati woke up early.

As he started to gain wakefulness,
he realized that his heartbeat was speeding up.
He hadn't been able to sleep early last night, either.
After all, this was the last day he would be de Alugbati.

The officially-sanctioned knapsack lay on the bunk
beside his head.
It contained all the personal belongings
assigned to him.

As he got up, he realized that his sister's bunk was
already empty,
and that the bunk was already properly @emph{made}.
He got up and started to make his own bed,
and prepare for today.

@sp 2

The government-issued clothes in his knapsack
felt stiff and pinched his skin a little,
but he was not allowed to wear anything else
to the Seedling initiation ---
or even to bring anything other than himself,
the knapsack, and the contents of the knapsack,
as issued.
No Seedling could be allowed an unfair advantage,
and if his parents had been so inclined,
they could give him
a very, very unfair advantage indeed.

They were also very, very unlikely to be so inclined.

The clothes were a simple white shirt
and knee-length pants,
with corresponding underwear and socks.
They looked similar to his school uniform,
which had been returned to the school
several days ago.

He rummaged through his knapsack again,
knowing that there could be nothing extra there,
but he still persisted irrationally in checking.
The computation pad, 3D-printed personal items,
medikit, choline supplements,
notebook and pencil, sets of clothes...

@sp 2

He'd woken up early, but his parents and sister,
it turned out, had woken up even earlier.
The table was already set,
his older sister Stephanie and Mommy Lizet
were already sitting down waiting for breakfast,
which Mommy Maria was helping Daddy Mike to cook.

Their two younger siblings, Rudy and Rayne,
were probably still sleeping;
they had school today,
and in any case were not allowed to witness
the Seedling initiation ceremony.

Well, perhaps Mommy Lizet,
with her half-lidded eyes,
was not yet actually completely awake either.

Stephanie was fidgeting, which worried Marco a little,
but then he reflected on his own racing heart
and his dry mouth.
She was, quite likely, nervous just like him ---
or maybe excited would fit her personality more.
Marco wondered how she would say goodbye
to her boyfriends;
none of those he knew about were old enough
to be part of this year's Seedling initation.

``Good morning,'' said Stephanie.

``Good morning,'' said Marco.

Daddy Mike and Mommy Maria
looked up from the frying fish,
and chorused a ``Good morning;''
Mommy Lizet remained sitting upright
for a while,
then turned to him and murmured a slurred
``Good morning.''

``We heard your sister messing up the kitchen
so early in the morning,''
said Daddy Mike.
``She said she was @emph{really} hungry,
she hadn't slept well,
so I thought we'd have an early breakfast
and leave before
your little brother and little sister
go to school.
I guess my little sweets are old enough
to take care
of getting ready for today.
I'll just leave breakfast for them.''

``Please give Lizet her coffee,'' said Mommy Maria,
handing it to Marco,
``you know how she is in the mornings.
We'd planned on bringing you later
so that Rayne and Rudy could say goodbye properly,
but your sister's so excited.
I'll have to re-explain later to Lizet
why we're changing plans
once she gets her brain properly working.''

Marco placed the cup in front of Mommy Lizet,
then put his knapsack in his chair.

``I'll...'' he started, then he cleared his throat.
``I'll just go outside a bit.''

``You're not going to eat breakfast?'' asked Stephanie.
``You're even more excited than I am!''

``I'll eat breakfast when it's ready,'' he said.
``I just need some fresh air right now.''

He opened the door of the common room to the outside
and stepped on the deck of their homeboat.
He walked over to the public-use part of their deck,
connected by pontoon bridges to other homeboats.

His parents' homeboat and his parents' deck,
he corrected himself mentally.

He looked at their neigbors' homeboats,
looked up at the dark blue sky,
and looked at the brightening to the east.
He breathed in the salt breeze of the sea a few times,
to build up his strength.

This was the day he had been anticipating and dreading.

After a particularly big breath,
he let out a whoop with all his strength
in the direction of the dawning sun.

@sp 2

``What was that for?'' said Stephanie
as he re-entered the common room.
His parents were all grinning at him
as they sat around the central table,
even Mommy Lizet.

``Sorry,'' said Marco, taking his seat
and smelling the fried fish.
``I just had to let it out.''

``@emph{You're} more excited than I am,'' she said.

``You're the one who woke up all our parents early
and made them change their plans.''

``Yeah, you're just the one
who woke up all our @emph{neighbors} early,
and made them change @emph{all} their plans,
most likely.''

Marco shrugged.  ``Yeah, I guess.
I don't really know what got into me.
I just wanted some air, and then I couldn't help it,
I just wanted to shout.''

Stephanie rolled her eyes.  ``And you're supposed
to be the one with all that @emph{self-control}.''

``Doesn't mean I have an infinite amount of self-control,
and that was just according to the results
of the standard test they give everyone at five years old,''
said Marco.

He took a fish and then noticed something else on the table.
``Carbo bars?''

``Today's a special day,'' said Daddy Mike,
looking up from the common room's computation pad,
which he was fiddling with.
``You both need lots of energy.  Anyway...
we've been trying to connect to your Daddy Red,
but I guess he's still sleeping.
Ah, there he is.''
He set up the pad in its location
at the end of the common room table,
where they could all see it and be seen by its camera.

``What's up?'' said Daddy Red.
The video was dark,
but his bleary eyes were obvious.
``Why so early?  It's five in the morning.''

``Oh, nothing,'' said Daddy Mike.
``We just promised to ekiga you
before we brought the kids
to the Seedling initiation.
So we're calling now,
since Steph and Marco are so excited,
they want to go soon.''

``Not really, dad,'' said Stephanie.
``I was planning for a midnight snack,
or rather an early-morning snack,
but I knocked down some pans
and that woke Daddy Mike up.''
She then whisperred loudly, winking,
``You know, I think Daddy Mike wasn't
actually @emph{sleeping} at all,
he was just waiting for an excuse to get up.
Because he's the most excited of us all.''
She then smiled innocently at Daddy Mike,
batting her eyelashes.

Daddy Red laughed.
``Yeah, that does sound like your Daddy Mike.
You know how deep he sleeps normally.
I've dropped pans while cheating an early-morning snack
and @emph{he} never woke up to make me breakfast!''

``You know that's not true, Redemptor,'' said Daddy Mike,
his faced flushed.
Mommy Maria, Daddy Red, and Stephanie laughed.

``Oh, and guess what?'' said Mommy Maria.
``So Stephanie got up early and woke us all up.
You know what your son Marco did, when he got up?
He went outside and woke all our neighbors up!''

``What?'' said Daddy Red.

``No I didn't!'' Marco objected.
``I just whooped once!''

``It was a really big shout,
I'm sure they heard it all the way
up to Rationality One,''
said Stephanie.

``What did Marco do?'' said Daddy Red.

``Nothing really, I just went outside
for a good breath of fresh air
while waiting for breakfast,
then I just whooped once!''

Daddy Mike, Daddy Red, Mommy Maria and Stephanie laughed.
Even Mommy Lizet smiled through the fog of drowsiness.

Marco sighed, digging into breakfast.

``Why don't you eat breakfast too?''
Daddy Mike asked Daddy Red.

``Canteen's probably not open yet,'' said Daddy Red.
``And I'll probably go back to sleep when you go.''

``How about you, Lizet?'' said Daddy Mike.

``Just coffee, sweetheart,'' said Mommy Lizet.

``Just coffee isn't healty, sweets,'' said Daddy Mike.
``It'll be a tiring day for all of us.''

``My brain isn't working yet, so it cannot possibly verify
the validity of that statement, so just give me the coffee,
sweetheart.''

``It's been right in front you since Marco put it there,
Lizet,'' said Mommy Maria.

``I'm going to need more.  A lot more.
I feel so sleepy today, sleepier than usual.
What time is it anyway?''

``Have a carbo bar at least,'' said Daddy Mike, offering one,
which Mommy Lizet took, dipping it into the coffee.
``It's about a quarter after five.''

``Why are we up so early?  I thought we would eat breakfast
after Rudy and Rayne leave for school?''

Mommy Maria grinned.  ``Because Stephanie woke up really early.
And now Marco's awake too.
They're excited to begin the Seedling initiation,
so Mike and I decided to bring them early.
I probably need to record this explanation because
that's the third time you asked that question this morning.''

``Really?''

Stephanie giggled.  Mommy Lizet absently patted her hand.

``Why don't we wake Rudy and Rayne up?'' asked Marco.
``I know it's early and the schoolboat
won't pass here until seven thirty,
but at least we can say goodbye personally.''

``They were up late last night doing school projects,''
said Daddy Mike.  ``Let them sleep.
Waking them up is bad for their health.''

``It's just one day, dad,'' said Marco.

``That's what I told him, too,'' said Mommy Maria.

``Marco and Steph can just write notes for them.
And kiss them but don't wake them.''

``Nothing's as good as saying goodbye in person,''
said Stephanie.  ``Or at least by ekiga,'' she added,
winking at Daddy Red, who smiled back.

Daddy Mike grumbled.  ``Fine, then.
But finish your breakfast first,
my little sweets will want to eat when they get up
and we don't have enough seats here.''

``Anyway,'' said Daddy Red, ``the reason I wanted
to ekiga you before you left, is, well, Mike?''

``Uh, yes, Red.  Sweets, you have to wake up @emph{now},''
Daddy Mike told Mommy Lizet, poking her.

Mommy Lizet drank the rest of her coffee
in a single gulp.
She blinked, then breathed deeply.
``Children --- Stephanie, Marco --- today is your
Seedling initiation.  When you enter the Seedling boats,
you'll stop being de Alugbati, and become ex Alugbati.
And later when you form families of your own,
you'll pick a new family name for your own family.''

Her eyes drifted back into sleepiness.
Marco almost wanted to laugh at this,
but he guessed that this was a solemn leavetaking.

Stephanie grinned at it, though.

``So starting today,'' said Daddy Mike, ``you don't have to call
us `mom' or `dad' anymore.  Today, you'll start becoming adults.
A year from today, you'll officially be adults.
And then, you shall be equal in standing,
in the eyes of our laws and our culture, to us.''

``We hope you become upstanding, successful, and public-minded citizens,''
said Daddy Red, ``of whatever platform you choose to call your home.
We hope that you remember this:
for fifteen years, you were of the Alugbati family,
and we have always strived to instill the values
that we believe are necessary,
for the success of an individual,
for the success of a family,
and for the success of a sea platform.''

``And for the success of all of humanity,'' said Mommy Maria.
``Perhaps some day you too shall have children,
which you too shall send off as Seedlings
when they grow to this age.
And you too will know this:
that you love your children,
that you will want to protect them and to guide them,
and that the best thing to do is to let them go
and make their own path.''

``We love you,'' said Daddy Mike.
Their other parents nodded in agreement.

There was a moment of silence.

Marco forced himself to speak.  ``I love you too,''
he said.  Then, tentatively, ``Mike, and Red, and Fara
Lizet, and Maria --- I love you too.''

``I love you too, moms, dads,'' said Stephanie.
``I know we don't @emph{have} to call you that anymore
but you didn't say we have to @emph{not} call you that ---
so I'm going to call you that.  Is that okay?''

Their parents chuckled.
``I think it's okay with us, if you really want to,''
said Redemptor.

``Thanks,'' said Stephanie.  ``I really want to.
I'm really happy.  And nervous, and excited.
Thank you, moms, dads.''

@node The Walk of the Seedlings
@chapter The Walk of the Seedlings

Rudy and Rayne waved them off
as Marco and Stephanie crossed the threshold
between the private and public-use areas of the deck.

``Remember to e-mail us!'' said Rayne.

``We will!'' said Stephanie.

``Of course we will,'' said Marco.

``Take care!  Make sure to come back
and give us lots of money!
You know how tightwad Daddy Mike is!''
said Rudy.

``I heard that, Rudy,'' said Michael Alugbati.
Rudy stuck out his tongue at his father.

``So,'' said Marco, as they stepped off
their parents' homeboat
onto a pontoon connected to their neighbor,
``do we get a taxi?''

``No,'' said Michael, ``traditionally,
Seedlings are supposed to walk from their ex-homes
to the Seedling launch location.''

``But @emph{dad},'' said Stephanie,
``that can't be a tradition,
the Seedling initiations were started
just ten years ago,
this is just the fourth Seedling initiation,
there's not enough time for there
to be a tradition like that!''

``Sounds like just the right time
to start a tradition to me,''
said Michael.

``Wouldn't walking be fundamentally unfair?''
said Marco.
``I mean, some Seedlings would start farther
from the Seedling launch site than others.
Isn't the intent of the Seedling initiation
supposed to be to give an equal start to all
R1 and R2 teenagers?''

``It's not as if being tired
on this particular day
would have that big an effect
on your future.''

``But it @emph{could},'' said Stephanie.
``We'd be too tired to talk properly
to our roommates during Self-Introduction,
which could make us appear to be less valuable
as allies later on,
thus making us less actually valued by our peers
and greatly reducing our chance
of becoming successful.''

Michael just sighed loudly.

``Stop teasing your dad, sweethearts,''
said Fara Elizabeth Alugbati.
``Or your ex-dad, as your choice may be.
In any case, you won't have any access to money
until you get on the Seedling boats,
and we're not going to spring any to pay
for a taxi.''

``What if we memorized the private key
to the family wallet?'' asked Marco.

``Then accessing it after we kicked you
out of our homeboat would be stealing,
sweetheart,'' said Lizet.
``That is punishable by the laws
of pretty much every platform of Sea State.
The Alugbati family affiliates as a citizen of R1,
which most definitely has stealing as an illegal act,
and you would be punished
whatever the jurisdiction you decide to live under.
Starting this day you are viewed by the state of R1
and the various R2 platforms
as prospective adults.
You would then be treated as adults
if you access the property, without permission,
of an R1-affiliated citizen.''

``We lack sleep, Daddy Mike,'' said Stephanie.
``It's unhealthy to walk all the way to
Rationality One in this state,
hopping onto different pontoons and homeboats.
We might slip due to drowsiness and drown.
How could we be successful that way?''

Michael just sighed again.  Maria, Lizet, Stephanie,
and Marco just laughed and hugged him.

@sp 2

Their route required them to pass through
the public-use area of Lancer ex Caballeros' homeboat.
The two fully adult women almost had to drag
Michael off of the pontoon onto the deck
of the infamously eccentric old man's homeboat.

Marco stared at one of the reasons
for Michael's reluctance ---
a large sign on Lancer's private deck
with the following slogans:

@display
Strength from Diversity
Diversity from Tolerance
Tolerance from Understanding
Understanding from Rationality
@end display

A thickset, white-haired man
emerged onto the homeboat's private deck
and waved to them.
As usual, he was wearing his naval uniform,
emblazoned with advertisements from the sponsors
of his old navy.
Seeing him, Michael forced a pleasant smile
on his face and nodded in greeting.

``Good morning, neighbors!'' said Lancer.
``Hello, children.  Or I suppose you are Seedlings, now?''

``Sir, yes, sir, ex-admiral sir!'' said Stephanie,
smiling.

Lancer stood at attention and saluted.
``Succeed, Seedlings!
And remember that you're the future of R1 and all the R2's.
And if you can't decide on what to do with your life,
well, there's the navy!
Look up the Sea Strikers, or our siblings-in-arms,
the Ocean Hunters!''

Marco and Stephanie saluted in response,
then laughed and waved goodbye
to the eccentric retired navyman.

Michael, the last to step onto Lancer's homeboat,
was the first to hop onto the pontoon connecting it
to the next homeboat.

@sp 2

``It's illegal, that's what it is,'' said Michael.

``Just let it go, Mike,'' said Maria.
``He's just a harmless, eccentric old man,
all the kids like him,
they like hearing his stories of patrolling the high seas
and fighting sea pirates.''

``They haven't finished debating the merits and demerits
of that set of slogans,'' said Michael.
``He should keep it on R2 where the politics is done.
He could have just settled down on one of the R2 platforms
after retirement.
We'll vote for the slogans, or not vote for them,
after the R2's have finished their debates.
Let @emph{them} be the ones to subject their families
to the cutting edge of sociopolitical structures!
We chose R1 so that we could live in stability.
And all those advertisements!
On his clothes, on his deck, on top of his cabin,
he probably has them on his underwear.''

``You know how much he loves his old navy, sweetheart,''
said Lizet.
``He arranged for them to update him with
the current advertisements of their sponsors
and he puts them on his boat.
On the private part of his boat,
so that's not really any of our business.''

``The man's right to throw around garish photons ends
where my retina begins.''

``Now, Mike,'' said Maria,
``Remember, `Strength through Diversity.'
It takes all kinds of people to make a society.
And our own homeboat isn't pretty, either,
with all those weird things
Lizet and Red keep making
to get more electrical power
for the bitcoin mining rigs.''

``Bah, don't quote them to me!
I don't like hearing them.
It'll bias me when the R2 debates end
and R1 has to vote on whether to accept or reject them.''

Maria shrugged.  ``I don't know why Mike hates Lance so much,''
she whispered to Lizet.

``Oh, and you quoted it wrong,'' Michael added.
``It's `Strength @emph{from} Diversity,' not `through'.''

Behind his back, Lizet, Maria, Marco, and Stephanie
grinned at each other.

@sp 2

After a while, they realized that the route
they had chosen was broken.
Some homeboat had undocked from the pontoons,
and the gap was much too large to jump easily.
Michael and Lizet brought out their
personal computation pads to check the maps.

``It's still registered as being there,''
said Lizet.

``But it's not there, obviously, sweets ---''
Michael started to say.

``Just as obviously, sweetheart, it moved just today,
maybe not even an hour ago,
since the online map hasn't updated yet.
Maybe they have Seedlings to bring
to the Seedling initiation
and decided to bring their entire homeboat.''

Michael snorted.  ``Tragedy of the commons,''
he said.  ``If everyone did that,
there'd be too many homeboats clogging the area
around Rationality One each Seedling initiation.''

``I could just throw them across the gap,''
Maria offerred, flexing her muscles.

``Mom!'' the two Seedlings chorused.

``And toss all of you, too,'' said Maria.

``And who would toss you?'' said Michael.

``You could go on without me,'' said Maria.
``Go!  Run!  Before the Seedling boats leave the docks!
Run and chase your destiny, my Seedlings!''
she continued, in mock drama.

``We shall never forget your great sacrifice, dear mother!''
said Marco, laughing.

``Sweethearts, stop fooling around,'' said Lizet.
``Here's a new route with that boat made unpassable.
We'll just backtrack a little and go through that
pontoon bridge instead,'' she pointed.

``Or we could call that taxi over there,
my feet hurt already,'' said Stephanie.
``This knapsack's heavy.''

``Challenges make you stronger,'' said Michael.
``Let's go.''

``Wrong, dad, it goes
`what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.'
All this walking is killing me,
so walking can't make me stronger!''

Michael ignored her.

``Wait, I have a better idea,'' said Stephanie.
``Marco could carry me and my knapsack!''

``Definitely not, Steph,
you've been gaining weight recently,'' said Marco.

``I'm not, and you know it!'' said Stephanie.
``I know, I'll just call one of my boyfriends
and have him treat me to a taxi ride
to Rationality One.''

``Steph,'' Michael said, ``do you want to enjoy
these last few moments you'll have
with your parents before you go
on a one-year trip of self-discovery, or not?''

Stephanie's grin fell.  ``I want to be with you,''
she said.  ``I'm sorry.''

``Let's go and @emph{walk}, then.''

After a while,
Stephanie ran up to Michael and hugged him.
``Sorry, dad,'' she said.
``But I suddenly realized that these are also
the last moments I'll have
to tease you personally!''

@sp 2

The Alugbatis encountered
more and more families with their Seedlings
as they approached the ship Rationality One.
Marco could son make out a queue of Seedlings,
in their plain white, government-issued shirts,
on the deck of the converted warship.

A ramp led from a pontoon to that part of the ship.
An official stood at the lower end,
allowing only Seedlings to pass through.
A small crowd of well-wishing parents stood around her,
watching their Seedlings as they waited in line
for their ship assignments.

``Welcome to Rationality One,'' said Maria.
``This is where our walk ends.''

Marco and Stephanie started hugging their parents.

Lizet hugged Marco and kissed him.
Marco felt her press a small, flat and round
metallic object into his hand.
Then she whispered, ``this may be useful to you soon.''

When he looked at her in surprise, she whispered,
``Go west, sweetheart, and use this for the benefit
of all of humanity.''

He pocketed it, hoping nobody noticed.
He recognized it from its shape and composition.

His heart pounding, he approached the official
and gave her his papers,
hoping that he wasn't obviously sweating
and that his polite smile didn't look fake.
He rushed up the ramp when she let him pass.

It was something that gave him an unfair advantage.
It was something he never expected his parents
to give him, not as a Seedling.

It was a physical bitcoin.

@node The Seedling Counselor
@chapter The Seedling Counselor

``Marco de Alugbati,'' said the man behind the desk,
in a tiny government office onboard
the de facto government center Rationality One,
after Marco gave him the Seedling acceptance letter.
Behind the man was a poster of a pair of staring eyes.
``Genetic child of Redemptor and Fara Elizabeth Alugbati,
registered child of Redemptor, Fara Elizabeth, Maria,
and Michael Alugbati.''

``Yes, sir,'' said Marco.

``I'm Ricardo,'' the man said.
``Cognitivist Ricardo Derrick,
but just call me Ricardo.
I'm your Seedling counselor,
and I will conduct a short interview with you.
Then you will be evaluated and,
if deemed acceptable,
your name will be formally changed from
Marco de Alugbati to Marco ex Alugbati.
Are you ready?''

``Yes, Ricardo,'' said Marco.

``Good,'' said Ricardo, tapping on the keyboard
on his desk, not meeting his gaze.  ``Let's begin.''

Ricardo asked Marco a series of simple,
objective questions;
the cognitivist focused intently
on the computer screen.

``What's your age?''  ``Fifteen years and a month.''
``Have you completed basic education?'' ``Yes.''
``Have you completed intermediate education?'' ``Yes.''
``Have you completed basic rationality training?'' ``Yes.''
``How often do you socialize with friends?''  ``About once a week.''
...

And then the question that made Marco slip.

``Are you carrying anything other than the standard-issue
Seedling knapsack?''

Marco could almost say ``No.''  But, involuntarily,
his eyes met the staring eyes on the poster for a moment.
It made him pause.

Ricardo looked at him.  ``So, Marco,'' he said,
``you @emph{are} carrying something extra, aren't you?''

Marco nodded.
He felt the blood rush to his face,
and found himself
unable to meet Ricardo's eyes.

``A neat trick, isn't it?'' said Ricardo.
``Those eyes behind me, I mean.
Old cognitivist's trick.
While interviewing you we are not suppoed
to look directly at you,
as that would bias our judgment.
But seeing eyes stare at you forces you
to be honest.
And those unblinking, perenially staring eyes
up there force you to be very, very honest.''

Marco said nothing.

``That's strange,'' said Ricardo,
looking up something on his computer.
``You are listed as having surprisingly high
self-control, at least when you were five years old.
And you're de Alugbati.
Your parents are famous
for taking our laws and customs very seriously,
and for being extremely concerned about, and I quote,
`giving our rightful share for the advancement of society.'
I wouldn't have thought that you would bring
anything other than the items that were issued to you.
So what, exactly, are you bringing in?''

Marco fumbled for the coin in his pocket.
He showed it to Ricardo,
the placed it on the desk.

``What is it?'' Ricardo asked, frowning.

``It's a Casascius physical bitcoin,'' said Marco.
``It has a face value of twenty-five bitcoins,
as you see here under the big bitcoin symbol.
The `vires in numeris'
on the left side of the bitcoin symbol
means `strength in numbers,'
and is meaningful at several levels.
The number `2011'
on the right side is the year of minting.
Here on the flip side of the coin
is the tamper-resistant hologram label;
the eight printed characters in the center
are the first eight characters
identifying a bitcoin wallet
supposedly containing the face value amount.
Peeling off the hologram label will reveal
a small card containing the private key
that allows access to the bitcoin wallet,
and there is no conventional method
of returning the label afterwards.
This coin appears to be untampered,
although you should realize that less than a decade
after this coin was released,
enthusiasts had already found a way
to extract the card
without the tampering being evident.
Minting of this particular series of coin
was stopped almost immediately.
Currently, most of its value is actually
in its collectibility;
many collectors consider the face value
to be essentially zero,
and it is the coin itself,
being of limited minting,
that is valued.
I'd estimate it to be worth about
a hundred bitcoins
at an antiques shop today,
and a collector might be willing
to go as high as a hundred fifty bitcoins for it.''

Ricardo blinked.

``Mr. de Alugbati,'' Ricardo said,
``your family's business is bitcoin mining.
I must confess that as a cognitivist,
I only use bitcoins for receiving my salary
and paying for things.
Private keys, wallets ---
can you explain them to me?''

Marco nodded.  ``Well,
I suppose you have a bank account somewhere,
probably at R1 Bank?''

``Yes.''

``Now, a bank account is just
a name attached to a number,
the number being the amount of cash you own.
Your bank account is, of course,
protected by a personal identification number
or PIN, correct?''

``Correct.''

``So a bank account is just a name,
attached to a number, protected by a PIN.
Now, imagine the bitcoin system
as a giant, worldwide bank.''

``I don't see how the bitcoins system
would work like a bank.''

``Well, a bank is just a set of bank accounts, right?
And a bank account is just a record containing the name,
the current balance, and the PIN.
At the simplest and most naive level,
you could implement a bank as a set of index cards.
The bitcoin system is just a very special method
of storing that information on very many computers
over the Internet, with lots of encryption to ensure
that the none of the computers can be programmed
to cheat.''

``I see.''

``Think of each wallet as a `bank account,' associating a name ---
or rather, what we call the `public key' of the wallet ---
with a number, the number being the balance of bitcoins
in that wallet.
We use the public key instead of a name,
to allow anonymity ---
much like a numbered Swiss bank account.
The bank account is protected by the `private key,'
which is something like a PIN protecting the bank account.''

``Ah,'' said Ricardo, ``so this physical bitcoin is something
like a bank access card with the PIN written on it.''

``Yes, although the PIN is hidden by a tamper-resistant label.''

``How would I use it?''

``Well, one way of paying another person would be
to open an anonymous numbered bank account,
deposit the needed amount of money,
write the PIN on the bank access card,
then wrap the bank access card in a tamper-proof package
and give it to the other person.
The person would then be able to open the tamper-proof
package to withdraw the money.
Or alternately, he or she could pass it, still wrapped,
as payment to a third person,
who could further pass it to a fourth, and so on.''

``It doesn't seem to be very practical to me.''

``Well, creating a new bitcoin wallet is much easier
than opening an anonymous numbered bank account,
but you're correct, it is relatively impractical.
If both you and the other person have an account
in the same bank,
it's far easier to just transfer the amount
between your accounts.
And that's what a payment
in the bitcoin system actually is:
an inter-account transfer.
The impractical nature of these coins meant
that they were more of a publicity stunt
for the bitcoin system;
their impracticability is the reason for why
they had limited minting.
But today, the value of the coin is driven
by the historic nature of the coin
as an early publicity stunt
at a time when bitcoin was considered a passing fad,
and the limited minting of these coins.
It is valuable because it is impractical.''

Ricardo smiled.  ``Ironic, I suppose.
The value you just quoted me ---
a hundred bitcoins ---
is too large for me to overlook.
But knowing your family, a hundred bitcoins
wouldn't be much to them.
If I had been asked to imagine your parents
giving you something valuable,
something that would give you
an advantage over your peers,
I would have imagined them giving you
at least a thousand bitcoins,
and I'd probably seriously consider
ten times that.
They donated a thousand bitcoins
for this year's Seedling fund,
so anything they'd give to you
would have to match that.
And to risk this kind of scandal,
to only give you a hundred bitcoins...''
Ricardo shook his head.
``This was given to you by your parents?''

``Yes,'' said Marco.  ``Mommy Lizet ---
Fara Elizabeth Alugbati ---
gave it to me.
Just a little while ago.''

``Very strange.''
Ricardo rubbed his lips,
his forehead knotted.
``The value of this coin would be sufficient grounds
for me to cancel your Seedling acceptance letter
and have you discreetly sent back home.
But no matter how discreet it would be,
someone would know that you were caught trying to cheat.
Your parents would lose significant influence
once word of this leaks out,
and you would find your Seedling initiation delayed
until the next initiation.''

Ricardo leaned back in his chair.
``Did she tell you anything about it?''

``Well, all she told me was that
I might find it useful, and to go west
and help humanity.''

Ricardo raised his eyebrows,
but otherwise said nothing for a long while.

@sp 2

``Sir?'' asked Marco, ``does this mean that
I have to go...?''

``Can you try to remember exactly
what she told you?''  Ricardo said,
as if Marco hadn't asked a question.

``Uh... It went something like:
`You might find it useful soon.
Go west, sweetheart, and use this
to benefit all humanity.'
That's all I remember.''

Ricardo picked up the coin
and held it out to Marco.

``Take it.  I'm going out on a limb
and say that you never mentioned this,
and I trust that you will not
mention the coin to anyone,
until the time you need to use it.
Go on, take it.''

Puzzled, Marco took the coin.
At the brief touch,
he realized that Ricardo's hand was shaking.

``So she said `go west,' did she?'' asked Ricardo.
``Thank you for telling me.
There are --- some organizations, part of Sea State,
with particular code words and phrases.
Your parents are an important contact point
for one of those organizations.
As part of a --- common code ---
`go west' has a particular meaning.
It means: `prepare for imminent war.'
Your parents have just sounded a warning,
and used you, and most likely your sister,
to transmit that warning
to the central government of R1
and its associated sea platforms.''

``My parents are @emph{spies}?''

``Information processing nodes, actually.
Spymasters, not spies.''

Marco could not think of a proper reaction
to this revelation.

Ricardo smiled.
``Your parents are known to be very clever.
Especially Red and Lizet.
If you had managed to pass through this interview
without mentioning the coin,
then you would have accepted their advice
at the literal level.
Which means that you would, literally,
want to go west from R1.
So I suggest that you continue to follow the
literal meaning of the advice: go west.
Head west, and convince your fellow Seedlings
to head west.
Cross the South Pacific.
Head for the Dunbarite platforms, if you can.
And @emph{use} that coin.
I suspect its value is far, far more than a mere
one hundred bitcoins.''

@sp 2

``Here are the formal papers attesting to
your change of name and status
from child of the Alugbatis --- de Alugbati ---
to an adult that has left the Alugbatis ---
ex Alugbati.
This sealed envelope is your randomly-assigned
room number.
When you exit this room, turn right
and then open your room number envelope,
then board your assigned ship
and look for your assigned room on that ship.''

Marco took the offered papers, but remained seated.
``Ricardo, I'm sorry, but this has been so fast ---
I was expecting to be sent home,
shamed for trying to smuggle in a physical bitcoin.
Now you're telling me I can go?''

``Son, what you just told me means that we will be
a lot less strict about what the Seedlings are
allowed to bring on board.
The Alugbatis have sounded the alarm.
We may need to consider evacuating R1 and the R2's.
Right now, getting you and your fellow Seedlings out there
takes higher priority than
merely ensuring fairness.
Go, Seedling, and keep that coin safe!''

@sp 2

When Marco finally mustered enough self-awareness
to stand and leave, he turned right and walked a little,
then stopped.

He stood there for a moment, looking behind him.

Another Seedling exited from an adjacent office,
running past Marco.
Another Seedling then walked up from the waiting
area on a lower deck, and entered that office.
Then another Seedling exited another counselor's office,
jumping in joy, and soon another one entered timidly
into that office.

For a long while,
nobody entered Ricardo Derrick's office
after Marco left it.

@sp 2

As if in a dream, he opened the sealed envelope.

Seedling boat 3, room number 2.

He stood, staring at the paper.  He felt light and dizzy.
Everything around him felt somehow unreal and impossible.
He wondered whether to continue onward or turn back.

If war was imminent, wouldn't it be better
to be with his family?
With Rudy and Rayne and Daddy Mike and Mommy Lizet and
Mommy Maria and Daddy Red?

@emph{Your parents are known to be very clever.
Especially Daddy Red and Mommy Lizet,
but they're all clever.
If you had managed to pass through that interview
without mentioning the coin,
then you would have gone on
with the Seedling initiation.
Which probably means that
going on the Seedling initiation
is the best course of action
your parents could come up with.}

With a deep breath, he continued in the direction
that Ricardo had indicated.

@node The Gardeners
@chapter The Gardeners

Sara ex Mulligan waited, in her old tub of a homeboat,
beside the newly 3D-printed hull of this year's
Seedling boat 3.
Her fellow Gardener, Renee Magnus,
should be arriving soon.

The cognitivists of Rationality One
were supposed to be the ones
who would brief Renee Magnus.

Except that a few minutes ago,
a cognitivist had contacted her by ekiga
and informed her that a situation had come up
that would require their attention.
They were too busy
to brief the new Gardener
on her duties.
She would have to be the one
to introduce Gardening
to her new partner.

The irregularity --- @emph{worried} her.

In previous years,
the cognitivists had insisted on
briefing her,
even though she had been part
of the Seedling project
even before it had been introduced
to R1 ten years ago.
She had been one of the first Gardeners
who had volunteered for a limited trial run
of the concept
on one of the R2 platforms,
before it could be accepted for voting
by the main, R1 platform.

A sleek, fast homeboat cruised beside hers,
stopping to align their public-use decks.

Sara ex Mulligan opened the door of her cabin
to greet Renee.

@sp 2

``Good morning,'' said Sara,
standing at the demarcating line between
the public-use and private parts
of Renee Magnus's homeboat,
once she had tied their decks together.

``Greetings,'' said the middle-aged woman
who emerged from the other cabin.
``I am Renee Magnus.
My husband Simon is inside.
Sara ex Mulligan, I presume?"'

``Yes,'' said Sara.
``Welcome to the Seedling initiation of
the R1 platform and all the R2 platforms.
You have volunteered to be a Gardener ---
a counselor, guide, and guardian
for our Seedlings.
You have thus been assigned to be
one of the two Gardeners
of Seedling boat 3, here.
Normally, this briefing would be conducted
by a cognitivist of Rationality One,
but, due to unavoidable circumstances,
I will be the one giving you this briefing.
Have you read the handbook?''

``I have,'' said Renee.  ``Please, do come in.''

Sara suppressed a slight fidget.
``Actually, I've prepared the presentation
on my homeboat's computer.
So I'd like to invite you to my own homeboat.
Your family may also attend,
although it may be a tight fit
if there are more than two people
in my cabin.''

``Ah --- thank you for your invitation.
I suppose my husband can wait for me.''

@sp 2

``Do you have any questions?'' asked Sara
at the conclusion of her briefing.

``Well,'' said Renee, ``no socialization
with your fellow Gardeners ---
that seems strange to me.''

``The cognitivists insisted on that,'' said Sara.
``The original Seedling initiation plan
did not have that rule,
but apparently the cognitivists worried
that the partner Gardeners might collude
in order to cheat the Seedlings
or otherwise abuse their position.
The reason for having two Gardeners per Seedling boat
is for them to keep an eye on one another,
as well as to keep an eye on the Seedlings themselves.
Apparently, a classic cognitivist piece of advice
is that dishonesty is limited
if there is a stranger monitoring you,
but the dishonesty rises and erases that effect
once you get become familiar and friendly
with the monitor.
Hence the no socialization rule.''

``But having you brief me on the rules
of Gardening ---''

``Is not normal procedure, actually.''
Sara wondered if continuing
on this conversation topic
was a good idea.
She did not know
the reason for this irregularity,
and she suspected that sharing her speculations
could be considered too near to socialization.

On the other hand,
this briefing, by itself,
could be considered a form of socialization ---

``So what @emph{is} normal procedure?''

``Normally, a fresh Gardener would be briefed
by certified cognitivists of Rationality One.
And they'd also insist that long-time Gardeners,
like me,
should also be briefed each time.''

``How long have you been a Gardener?''

Sara smiled thinly.
``I'd prefer to answer questions about
the rules of Gardening,
rather than personal questions about myself.''

``My apologies,'' said Renee.
``I suppose that falls under socialization.''

``Yes.''

``As to the rules of Gardening ---
the rules have been bent, haven't they?''
said Renee.
``I accept the reasoning for
why we should not socialize ---
but this briefing would make us,
at least a little,
more familiar with each other.
Which suggests to me
that your cognitivists
are currently very concerned
about something
they consider much more important
than the future of your precious Seedlings.
What could it be?''

Sara just shook her head.
She'd already thought as much,
on receiving the order
to handle this briefing by herself.

``Now, now,'' Renee pressed forward,
``The rule on not socializing with
your fellow Gardener has been bent.
I suggest that sharing information we have
has more valuable utility
than attempting to maintain a rule
whose spirit has already been violated.''

``You are from a Dunbarite platform,''
said Sara, still shaking her head.

``And what of it?'' Renee said, tightly.
``I am still a citizen of Sea State.
R1 may be the largest and most well-known
platform of Sea State,
it may serve as the de facto capital city
of Sea State,
it may have a navy of client platforms
it simply calls `the R2's,'
without even individual names ---
but this does not justify
your apparent mistrust, withholding
possibly vital information.''
Renee sniffed.
``Very well, then,'' she said,
when Sara continued her silence.
``I shall endeavour to gain your trust,
unjustified though I consider your mistrust may be.
I am part of a network of knowledge workers
who monitor world events.
A short while ago, a node of our network,
here on R1, went silent ---
suspiciously silent.
By backtracking through the information shared
and queries sent
by that node,
I concluded that this node had became worried
about the possibility
that Sea State might get into conflict ---
with what, I do not know.
That is, in fact,
the true reason for why I volunteered
for the cultural exchange program
between our platform and R1,
and why I volunteered to be
a Gardener for this year's Seedling initiation.''

``I see,'' said Sara.
She held up her hand, and said,
``Let me think for a moment.''

After a while, she said,
``Obviously, the reason for
their disregard for the Seedling's future
is their concern
for the Seedling's @emph{present}.''

``Obviously,'' said Renee.

``I'm not sure if it's relevant,'' Sara said,
``but the no-socialization rule
had been an important point
that the cognitivists of R1 insisted on.
To be honest, I thought it was quite impractical
to impose that rule
when they first proposed it ---
or rather, when they first insisted on it.
The cognitivists also recommended
shuffling the Gardeners
when the Seedlings get shuffled between boats,
to help enforce the needed separation.
To allow that rule to be bent now ---
means that the conflict you told me about
must be something to be taken seriously.''

``You've been with the Seedling program
since the beginning?''

``I've been a Gardener since the Seedling program
was prototyped on an R2 platform,'' Sara said,
unconsciously sitting a little straighter.
``So tell me, miss member-of-a-network ---
is war coming?
If war comes,
where can my beloved Seedlings grow?''

@node Seedling Boat 3; Room Number 2
@chapter Seedling Boat 3; Room Number 2

Marco climbed down the ladder
from Rationality One
leading to a boat
emblazoned with the sign
`Seedling Number 3.'
He presented his papers
to the official
standing at the demarcating line
between the public-use
and private parts of the boat's deck.

The official handed the papers back,
then said, with a practiced, cheery smile
and a slight bow,
``Welcome, Mr. @emph{ex} Algubati,
to Seedling boat 3!''

He was on the vessel he would call
his homeboat for at least three months.

His heart still pounding, not yet recovered
from the interview with the Seedling counselor,
he took the papers,
entered the private part of the deck,
and climbed a short staircase leading
to the rooms inside.

@sp 2

The room had four bunk beds, two on each of
the longer sides,
and two smaller doors
at the end opposite the entrance,
which Marco supposed led to toilets.
On the left-side upper bunk
lay a young man,
who appeared to be napping.

``Hello,'' Marco said softly.

``Oh, hello!'' said the young man,
who got up.
``Cheers de Littlefoot.
Err, I mean Cheers ex Littlefoot.''
He extended his hand.
``Pleased to meet you, roommate!
You are?''

``Marco ex Alugbati,'' said Marco,
closing the door
and reaching up
to shake Cheers' hand.

``Good, good,'' said Cheers.
``I'll confess I was hoping to be
the only guy in a room of girls,
but I guess I'll have to settle
for a much more normal two guys,
two girls setup.''

Marco forced himself to smile
at this crudity.
``I think most of us have fantasized
something like that.''

Cheers laughed.  ``No, no, my friend!''
His name certainly seemed aproppriate.
``You misunderstand.
We're all guys in my family.
So I was hoping to find out
what it is like
to live with girls.
Are they as noisy and strange as
my research has led me to believe?''

``I doubt real girls are as noisy
and strange as you are,''
said Marco.
``So your siblings are all boys?''

``Yes, but it's even worse than that,
roommate!''  said Cheers.
``My parents are both boys.
They're a homosexual couple.
I'm straight, to their lasting disappointment.
Straighter than a straight edge,
as my fathers like to say.
My younger brother is better in that regard.
He's the only sibling I have.
Anyway, welcome to Seedling boat 3's
room number 2.
Pick a bunk!
You can have any of those three.''

Marco threw his knapsack
into the remaining upper bunk
and climbed into it.
``So... are you adopted?'' he asked.
He suspected the question
would not be even remotely offensive
to his cheery roommate.

``Ah, no!'' said Cheers.
``I'm a biological child of both my fathers.
And my mystery deepens,
does it not, my friend?
It's hard to explain,
but I promise I'll tell all
at my Self-Introduction later,
when our room is complete.
Anyway, I got up very early today,
which is why I got this nice bunk,
which is fractionally nicer than yours,
and orders of magnitude better
than the bottom bunks.
You are to be complimented
on your choice of bunk.
In any case, as I mentioned,
I woke up early and
I'm a little sleepy right now.
I'll nap just a bit, okay?''

``Okay,'' said Marco.

Not knowing what to do,
and still not quite calm enough to sleep,
he opened his knapsack
and took out the computation pad.
He enabled it and waited for it
to connect to the ship's wireless.

@sp 2

The computation pad was a cheap, low-power model.
It had an electronic paper main display,
which took a half-second to refresh at each change,
and a smaller low-resolution black-and-white LCD display,
which was used to show the text he was currently entering.
It was far less powerful
than the computation pad
his parents had given him.
Still, it was all that he was allowed to use,
as a Seedling.

He wrote a short note to his family.

@quotation
Hello!

I'm on board!

I'm on Seedling boat 3, room number 2.
There's one other guy here now,
Cheers ex Littlefoot.
He's a little weird, I think.
He says he's girl-obsessed
because both of his parents are guys
and all he has
is a younger brother for a sibling.

He says he's the biological son
of both his fathers.
Don't know how that happened.
He says he'll explain everything later,
in Self-Introduction.

We're waiting for our two remaining roommates.
I guess they'll probably both be girls,
to balance things out.

Rudy, sorry, but I haven't earned lots of money yet.
You'll have to beg your Daddy Mike
to raise your allowance for now.

My love to you all.
I miss you already, Mike, Lizet, Red, Maria,
Rudy and Rayne.
I wonder if I'll get to be on the same boat
as Steph after the shufflings.
@end quotation

Then he sent the message by e-mail.

He debated with himself for a short while.
Then he created another e-mail,
addressed only to Fara Elizabeth Alugbati,
agonizing over almost each word,
crafting the message to be
as innocous as possible,
and yet having some meaning,
if you knew
particular bits of information beforehand.

@quotation
Hi mom!

I just had to tell my Seedling counselor,
Cognitivist Ricardo Derrick,
about your advice to go west.

He seemed to understand.

He agreed that I should use
the resources that all our parents
pooled together and gave to us Seedlings
to go west.

Love, Marco.
@end quotation

@sp 2

He waited for a reply from his family
for a moment,
but none came.

Then he wondered about the physical bitcoin
that his mother had given him.
The 8-digit code printed on the coin itself
was not long enough to identify the bitcoin wallet
containing the face value amount,
but he knew that files could be found
on the internet
which mapped Casascius physical bitcoin codes
to the full wallet address.

He found a few copies of that file,
which all matched up the same,
and then found a PGP signature
known to be made by Casascius himself
attesting to the veracity of those copies.
Keeping an eye on Cheers,
who seemed to be genuinely asleep,
he took out the coin
and copied the 8-digit code
into the computation pad,
then put the coin back
into his pocket.

He looked up the 8-digit code
in the file,
then copied the complete wallet address
and looked it up
on Block Explorer, @url{blockhain.info}.

To his surprise,
the wallet address contained
the full face value of twenty-five bitcoins.

But in order to withdraw it,
he would have to open the coin
and extract the private key
that would allow acccess
to the wallet.
Obvious tampering would drastically lower
the collector's value of the coin itself ---
which was much higher than the face value
of the coin ---
and he doubted he had enough skill
to peel and return the hologram label
without damage.

Then he heard a knock on the door,
disabled his computation pad,
and saw Cheers get up from his bunk.
He himself got up as the door opened.

@sp 2

``Hello,'' said the young man at the door.

``Hello!'' said Cheers.
``Cheers ex Littlefoot.
Pleased to meet you,
roommate!'' he said,
extending his hand.
``You are?''

``I'm Damian Carlo ex Mantis,''
said the young man.
``Call me Damian.''
He shook Cheers' hand.

``Hi Damian,'' said Marco,
extend his hand.
``I'm Marco ex Alugbati.
Pleased to meet you.''

``My pleasure,'' said Damian,
shaking his hand.

``Welcome to Seedling boat 3's
room number 2!'' said Cheers.
``You can have any
of the two bunks below us.''

Damian nodded and put his knapsack
in the bunk under Marco's.

``I have to confess,
I was hoping my last two roommates
would be girls,'' said Cheers.
``In order to properly balance
the room.
Ah well, I guess our last roommate
is our only hope
of a feminine touch.''

``Well,'' said Damian,
as he sat on his chosen bunk
and took out his computation pad,
``Given already two males in the room,
there's only slightly more than 25% chance
of getting two females in the remaining
two slots.''

Then Damian took out a small keyboard
and connected it to his computation pad.

``Hey, how'd you get that?'' asked Cheers.

``This keyboard?'' said Damian.
``Smuggled it in.
Not like it's gonna be a big advantage
over the rest of you, eh?''

``I guess,'' said Cheers.

``Sorry, but I'm a programmer,
and I hate touchscreeens,'' Damian said.
``Something wrong with my skin's galvanic response,
or something,
so that touchscreens sometimes fail
to register my tapping.
Touchscreens don't have tactile feedback,
and the worst combination
is this slow electrophoretic electronic paper display,
which means that the visual feedback is slow.
It's like trying to program with both hands tied
behind your back.
Still nothing faster than a touch typist
using a tactile, button-based, physical keyboard.''

``What did you say when the Seedling counselor
asked you if you were carrying items
that weren't in the standard-issue knapsacks?''
asked Cheers.

``Hmm?'' Damian said.  ``Don't remember being asked
about extra items.
Sounds dumb to ask that,
could just lie, right?
Prolly just weeding out idiots
who can't lie.''

``I guess,'' said Cheers.
He still frowned at
Damian's keyboard,
then shook his head.

Marco wished he could tell them
about the eyes, and the coin.

@sp 2

Cheers settled back down to nap,
and Damian leaned out of sight,
probably to program his computation pad.

Marco lay back again and checked his mail.

There was a message from Steph.

@quotation
Hey bro!

We're lucky!
I'm on Seedling boat 3 too!
Room 5.
Looks like I'll be seeing you!

There's a cute girl here,
maybe I'll introduce you to her,
what do you think?
She's Susan ex Guillermo,
from an R2 platform.

Your roommate Cheers sounds interesting!
I'm curious about how he got to be
the biological son
of both of his fathers.
That makes him sound like the unnatural product
of a laboratory experiment!

Anyway, Rayne, Rudy, study well
and maybe I'll send you something nice,
haha.
I love you two!
Hope you're comforting Daddy Mike,
he's probably crying about losing
two of his children
on the same day!
Hugs and kisses everyone!
@end quotation

After he finished reading Steph's e-mail,
he saw another message in his inbox.

It was from Red,
carbon-copied to all of his parents.

@quotation
Hello Marco,

It's good to know
that the cognitivists of R1
agree with us.

Love, Red.
@end quotation

@sp 2

Just as Marco had read Red's message,
he heard a knock on the door.
They all got up to greet their last
roommate.

Slowly, the door opened,
revealing a short young man.

Cheers grinned.  ``Hello!
Cheers ex Littlefoot.
Pleased to meet you, roommate!
You are?''
He extend his hand.

The young man bowed slightly,
his cheeks flushed,
and stuttered slightly.
``I'm J--- I'm John de ---
John ex Nikos.''
He bowed again.
``I'm pleased to meet you too,
and I hope we can work together
as roommates.''

``Hello,'' said Damian.
``Damian Carlo ex Mantis.''
They shook hands.

``Hello!'' said Marco.
``I'm Marco ex Alugbati.''
He extended his hand to John.

John beamed a lopsided, shy smile at him,
took his hand and shook it.
Then he bowed a little
and backed into the remaining empty bunk.

``Sadly, it seems that
we'll all be boys in this room,''
said Cheers.
``How unlikely could that get?''

``Not so unlikely,'' said Damian.
``One out of sixteen approximately.
Given 7 rooms a boat,
and seven boats,
expect maybe two or three
all-male rooms,
and maybe about the same number of
all-female rooms.''

``Maybe we'll get to be with girls
after the Shuffling
three months from now, eh?''
He winked at Marco,
then shook his head ---
possibly in mock sadness, Marco thought.

``Sorry,'' John said.
Marco heard Damian grunt.

``No need to be, roommate!'' said Cheers
``So!  It looks like we're all here.
Come on!''
He rubbed his hands, beaming at them.
``Let's start Self-Introduction!''

@node The Politician
@chapter The Politician

``Does anyone feel a pressing need
to volunteer to go first?'' asked Cheers.

``No,'' said Damian.
Marco shrugged and John shook his head.

``Ah well!'' said Cheers.
``Somebody has to go first,
so to break the ice,
I'll volunteer.''
He got off his bunk
and bowed.
Marco clapped a little.

``Hi, roommates!'' said Cheers, waving his hand.
``I'm Cheers ex Littlefoot,
as I told you all before.
I'm from an R2 platform.
My parents manage part of
the sea fertilization pumps
south of R1,
and also operate a fleet of fishing boats
as a side business.
But to be honest,
they don't really think of themselves
as enterpreneurs, or fishermen, or managers.
As they keep on telling me and my brother ---
they're politicians.
The work they do is
just to pay the bills.
But their @emph{passion},
their @emph{drive} ---
that's for politics ---
or in their own words,
designing the policies
to make human society
more efficient.''

``Wow,'' said John.

``Please, I am just the children of my fathers,''
said Cheers.
``I have yet to live up to their ambitions and dreams.''

``Fathers?'' asked Damian.

``As I told our good roommate Marco ---
my two parents are both male.
Papa Samuel and Papa Havelock Littlefoot.''

``Really?'' said John.

``Really!'' said Cheers.
``They keep saying over and over again that
they're gayer than a gay old time,
whatever that means ---
some old joke, I guess.
Oh, by the way ---
I am also the biological son
of both of my fathers!''
He grinned, teasing them,
then bowed again.

``You said that to me earlier,'' said Marco.
``How'd that happen?''

``Quite simply, actually,'' said Cheers.
``My fathers made a deal with 
lesbian couple
who also wanted to have children.
They would donate semen
for artificial insemination,
and my biological mothers
would get one child
and my fathers would get the other.
My fathers decided to combine their semen,
and with genetic profiling,
I turned out to be a genetic chimera,
with genes from both of my fathers.
So I am, in fact,
quite literally the son of my fathers.''

``What's a genetic chimera?'' said John.

``Multi-celled organism with
cells from different genetic lines,''
said Damian.
``Basically means that Cheers
should have been fraternal twins,
except the two fertilized egg cells
joined together to form one fetus
rather than two separate fetuses.''

``Thank you very much, Damian!'' said Cheers.
``A clear and concise explanation.
My gonads, after genetic testing,
turned out to be genetically from
Papa Havelock,
so I'm registered as the genetic child
of Havelock Littlefoot
and Michelle Wisteria.''

``Have you met your genetic mother?''
asked Marco.

``Oh, we visit each other occassionally,''
said Cheers.
``My genetic mother and her partner
is from the Dunbarite platform
`Sharp Insight.'
My half-sister Janelle de Wisteria
is just a few days older than me.
Age of adulthood on `Sharp Insight'
is 17 years old, though,
so I'm an adult before she is,
ha ha!''

``Why did your parents choose `Littlefoot'?''
asked John.

``I don't know,'' said Cheers.
``They never really told us about why
they chose that name.
Anyway, they were both
already highly active politicians
when they met each other
and started their relationship.
They said they enjoyed
debating with each other
on politics ---
`sparring sessions' is
what they would call it,
ha ha!''
John and Cheers chuckled.

Damian blinked.
``What's funny about `sparring session'?''

John cleared his throat.
``Well, while `sparring' is used to refer
to a one-on-one friendly competition
in a combat sport
for the purpose of training,
the base word `spar' itself
literally means a, um,
thick, strong wooden pole.
So, in the context of, um,
a homosexual male couple ---''

Damian groaned.
``Okay, okay, understood.''

``Thank you, John!'' said Cheers.
``Don't worry, my good roommate Damian,
it took me a @emph{very} long time
to understand
a lot of my fathers' jokes.
Papa Samuel likes to say it needs
a strong and sharp intellect
to really get into
and enjoy Papa Havelock's basest.''
He smiled even wider
than Marco had ever seen him smile so far.

Damian groaned again.

@sp 2

``Apologies, my friend!'' said Cheers,
bowing to Damian, as if he were a stage actor.
``I am the child of two men
who had a deeply nuanced enjoyment
for two things:
off-color homosexual innuendo and politics.
Despite being straighter than a straight edge,
I find that, like my beloved parents,
my passions are for the same.''

Marco started clapping,
which John and even Damian joined.

``So, Cheers,'' said Marco,
``I guess those would be
your hobbies?''

``Yes, Marco,'' said Cheers.
``The study of power,
the exercise of power,
the transfer and exchange of power,
and the words we use to justify
the actions that surround
the manipulation of power.
That, and how words can be arranged
into having both prosaic
and perverted meanings.''

John clapped, strong and vigorous.

``Thank you!'' said Cheers.
``I'm afraid that's all I can think of
to tell about myself.
Is there anything any of you
are curious about?''

``You said earlier that
you had a younger brother,''
said Marco.
``And you mentioned a sister, too.''

``My younger brother, Petrie de Littlefoot,
was born from another
arranged artificial insemination
with a different lesbian couple,
a few years after me;
he's 11, I'm 16.
He might be gay, like my parents,
which delights them, of course.
My sister Janelle de Wisteria is basically a sister
simply because her biological mother
is the family partner
of my own biological mother;
genetically, we have different parents,
as she got her genes from Daddy Samuel.
Neither of them are chimeras,
as it happens,
so they only have
two biological parents each.
Which makes them quite boring
compared to me,
right?''

``Your younger brother is named @emph{Petrie}?''
said John.
``That's quite interesting.''

``Why is that?'' said Cheers.

``Um, well...'' said John.
He appeared suddenly uncomfortable

``There is no need to explain, of course,''
said Cheers, smiling at John,
``although it does pique my curiousity,
roommate!
As you can see,
my parents seem to like
unusual names.''

John bowed slightly, then cleared his throat
and sat straighter.
``As far as I can remember,
the name `Littlefoot' is from a
classic animated video,
`The Land Before Time,'
released in the late twentieth century.''
said John.
``It's set at or near
the end of the age of the dinosaurs.
All the characters are dinosaurs
who can speak and think.
The story revolves around Littlefoot,
a baby apatosaurus,
whose mother dies,
leaving him orphaned.
He then goes on a quest
to search for the `Great Valley,'
which his mother always told him about,
and along the way
gathers a small group
of fellow orphaned dinosaurs
of various species.
Two other characters
are a female triceratops
named `Cera,' which I think
is suspiciously similar to `Cheers,'
and somewhat skittish male Pteranadon
named `Petrie.'
Littlefoot himself makes friends easily
and is the leader of his group of friends,
which I suspect
are traits that your parents value,
and is probably the reason why
they selected that name for their family.''

Cheers stood with his mouth open,
staring at John.

@sp 2

Once Cheers recovered, he laughed,
bowing to John.

``Thank you, my good friend!'' he said,
still chuckling.
``The Seedling initiation
is supposed to be
a year-long voyage
of self-discovery
for us.
And on my very first day,
you have helped me discover
important knowledge
about my own family.
I am in your debt,
John!''

John bowed, blushing.
``Th-thanks,'' he said.

``The pleasure is mine,'' said Cheers.
``Would any of you like to know more about me?
Or more importantly ---
perhaps some of you already know more
about me and my family
than I do myself, like John did?
Marco?  Damian?''

Damian shrugged.

``I can't think of anything more to ask,''
said Marco.

``Then I suppose my Self-Introduction
is done!'' said Cheers.
``Is there anyone who would like to volunteer
to be next?''

Damian, Marco, and John
just looked at each other
and shook their heads.

``Well, then!'' said Cheers.
``I propose that we do Self-Introduction
in the order that we arrived.
I was first,
then Marco,
then Damian,
then John.
Marco, if you please?''

@node The Banker
@chapter The Banker

Marco shrugged in resignation,
and descended from his bunk,
taking Cheers' place
in the middle of the room.

``Hello, everyone,'' said Marco.
``My name is Marco ex Alugbati.
I'm from R1.
My parents are primarily bitcoin miners,
and also have side investments.
I have an older sister,
Stephanie ex Alugbati,
who is also a Seedling now,
and, as I found out just a little while ago,
is actually on this same boat.
She's in room number 5.
Oh ---
I have four parents.
Although I guess that's far less interesting
than Cheers having two genetic fathers.''

``Don't worry about it, my friend!'' said Cheers,
``Each one of us here, I suppose, has his or her own
unique, fully interesting story.''

``His or @emph{her}?'' said Damian.

``If we were to refer to all Seedlings here today,
so to speak,'' said Cheers.
``So, Marco, as you were saying
about your four parents?''

@emph{They're spymasters, not spies, actually,}
some naughty part of Marco whispered
deep in the recesses of his brain.
@emph{Oh, and they gave me this
physical bitcoin,
which as a collector's item
is priced at maybe one hundred bitcoins.
Which is probably enough to buy
a used homeboat for myself,
plus some spare change
to start a small business.
And a cognitivist ---
a cognitivist! ---
thinks that it is somehow
far, far more valuable
than its fair market value
as a collector's item.}

What he actually said was,
``Yes, I have four parents.
Daddy Mike, Daddy Red, Mommy Lizet, and
Mommy Maria.
They originally were two separate couples,
but Daddy Red and Mommy Lizet
got into each other romantically
and intellectually.
They still loved
their spouses very much, though,
and still wanted to be with them.
So they convinced their spouses
to form a single larger family.
And it was from there
that the Alugbati family was formed.''

@emph{Is it true, though?} he wondered.
@emph{Or did they decide that their
`information processing node'
would be more efficient that way?}

``Wow,'' said John.
Damian gave him a bemused smile.

``You know, sometimes my friends
ask me what it's like
growing up with two male parents
and no female ones,'' said Cheers.
``But now you've got me wondering
what it's like
to grow up with two male parents
@emph{and} two female parents.''

``You know how you can ask your mom ---
or one of your dads, in Cheers' case, I guess ---
for something
and she denies it to you,
then you could try to ask, um, your other parent
and maybe the other one will give in to you?''
Marco said, pausing for greater impact.
``Well, I've got it even better,
because if I fail to convince two,
I still have two more chances
of getting what I want!''

They chuckled.

``You know,'' said Marco,
``a four-parent family is
actually more stable,
according to Daddy Red.
We call him `Rad Dad,' sometimes,
when our parents can't hear us,
because he can come up
with really great ideas.
We call Daddy Mike `Mad Dad,' too,
because he's usually the one who scolds us
about not fixing the beds,
things like that.''

Cheers asked, ``Why does your Rad Dad
say a four-parent family is more stable?''

``Childcare duties are more distributed,''
said Marco.
``And if you get in a fight with one partner
you can get comfort from two other partners,
and they can act as mediators between you.
You have more resources in total to pool togehter,
and you can cook larger meals more efficiently.
Four parents are not so large to coordinate,
so that's sort of like a sweet spot ---
more people to get more done,
but not so many that coordination
becomes a problem.
And so on.
Things like that.
To be honest,
I've lived with four parents for so long
that it's the idea of having just two parents
in a family
that seems @emph{weird} to me.
Although I suppose your point of view
would be drastically different.''

John nodded in sympathy.
Damian still looked bemused.

``And you know,'' said Marco,
``it's not likely the cognitivists
would allow polyamorous marriage
to be legalized
if their studies showed
it would have
any significant negative effect
on society.
As long as it was simply an option,
not something you'd be obligated to do,
anyway.''

``Still atypical,'' said Damian.

``Most people would have at least one trait
that's atypical,'' said Marco.

``I agree!'' said Cheers.
``Now, Marco, tell me something ---
just how does bitcoin mining work?''

Marco grinned.
``It might take some time to explain,''
he said.
``Are you sure you want me
to explain all that?''

@sp 2

``Why not?'' said Cheers,
looking at the others.
``It's Self-Introduction.''

Marco shrugged.
``Okay,'' he said,
``but no complaining about
how complicated it is, deal?''

The others nodded agreement.

``Good,'' he said.
``Now, first things first.
You know how banks
handle your bank accounts?''

Cheers shrugged, and John shook his head.
Damian said,
``Yeah, something congruent
to a mapping from a name to a bank balance
and security information.''

``Yes, something like that.
Basically, a bank account
is just a name attached to a number,
plus, as Damian said, security information.
The number is your bank balance.
The security information is something
like your birthday
or a parent's birth name.
Okay so far?''

The other nodded.

``Now the important part of the bank
is storing the account information:
basically, the big, master list
of the account name, account balance,
and security information.
And the bitcoin system is,
at its core,
just that.
In the bitcoin system,
the `bank account` is the bitcoin wallet,
and the `account name' is the wallet address.
The `security iformation' is the private key
to the wallet,
and the `account balance' is
the money in the wallet.
The entire bitcoin system
is simply the information about
the set of wallets ---
basically, the data of
the bitcoin bank accounts ---
stored across all the computers
of bitcoin miners all over the world.''

``Distributed hash table,'' said Damian.
To Marco, it sounded like
just so much gibberish.

``Wait, what ensures that
the bitcoin miners don't
transfer all the money
to their own, um `bank accounts'?''
said John.

``The security information
of the bitcoin wallet,''
said Marco.
``The security information
in the bitcoin system
is composed of two keys.
This is the public key:
it's the part of your security information
that is stored in the bitcoin system,
which, since it is duplicated
on each bitcoin miner's computer,
is effectively public information.
Then there's the private key,
which is not stored in the bitcoin system ---
it's private.
There's a special mathematical relationship
between the number representing the public key
and the number representing the private key.
This allows something to be encrypted
using the public key,
which can then only be decrypted
using the private key.
It also allows the inverse:
it allows something to be encrypted
using the private key,
which can then only be decrypted
using the public key.
Okay so far?''

``Okay,'' said Cheers,
``something encrypted with the public key
can only be decrypted with the private key,
and vice versa.''

``Good.
So if any bitcoin user
wants to transfer some money
from their account
to somebody else's,
they encrypt the request to transfer
using the private key.
The encrypted request
can be decrypted
using the public key.
So suppose I'm a bitcoin miner.
In order to verify that you are
the owner of the account,
you have to encrypt the transfer request
using the private key,
and since I know the public key,
I can verify that
by simply decrypting the transfer request
using the public key.
And no one,
not even the bitcoin miners,
can falsify a transfer request,
because even the bitcoin miners
would not be able
to encrypt using the private key,
because all we have
is the public key.''

``You said there's a mathematical relationship
between the public and private keys,''
said John.
``Wouldn't it be possible to derive one
from the other, then?''

``Yes --- in theory,
but not in practice.
You see,
there are certain mathematical operations
that are reversible,
but which are much easier to do one way
than the other way.
For example:
what are the two prime factors
of the number 91?''

Damian grinned.
The others just shrugged their heads.
``I don't think I still remember
how to do prime factors,''
said Cheers.

``Right.
But if I asked you to multiply
the numbers 7 and 13,
would you be able to do it?''

``With pen and paper, yes,''
said Cheers.
``Or a computation pad, ha.''

``Precisely.
Now, the prime factors of the number,
when multiplied together,
result in that number.
It's easier to do the multiplication
from the two prime numbers
than to get the prime factorization
from the product.
Similarly, the private key is
very hard to derive
from the public key:
it's the prime factors
of the public key.
But the public key is simply the product
of two components of the private key.
It's theoretically possible
to get the private key from the public key,
but it would require more computing hardware
than is available in the whole world.
See?''

John nodded.

Then Cheers said,
``That lets the bitcoin miner
verify that the bitcoin user
is allowed to transfer the amount.
How does the bitcoin user
make sure that the bitcoin miner
updates the account balances correctly?''

Marco smiled.
``A good point.
Now, the informal slogan
of the bitcoin system
is `vires in numeris:'
strength in numbers.
As I just said,
there's a special numeric relationship
between the private key
and the public key:
that's one strength in numbers.
The other strength is
the number of bitcoin miners
all over the world.
Basically,
each of the bitcoin miners
verify that each other's records
are correct,
using, again,
special numeric relationships.''

``What about collusion?''
said Cheers.
``A bunch of miners could say
that the records are correct
but cheat the users.''

``There's a mathematical puzzle ---
again, strength in numbers ---
that each miner tries to solve.
The first miner that solves this puzzle
wins a number of bitcoins,
which is how bitcoins are `minted,'
so to speak.
Then that solution becomes
the template for the next mathematical
puzzle.
Now, the winner not only needs
to show the solution,
the winner also needs to show
his copy of the records.
If the winner's records are incorrect,
then his win is invalidated.''

``I don't get how that stops collusion,''
said Cheers.

``Byzantine generals,'' said Damian,
a smug grin on his face.
Marco decided to ignore it.

``Well,'' said Marco,
``it means that the losers ---
the ones who didn't guess the correct solution
to the mathematical puzzle ---
want to show a mistake in the winner's records.
If the losers can show a mistake
in the winner's records,
then the win is invalidated,
and the winner does not get the newly-minted bitcoins.
Suppose we colluded to, say,
set John's account balance to zero,
even without a valid transaction.
And then I guess the correct solution
to the mathematical puzzle.
You could then show everyone else
the errors in my records,
and I wouldn't win the bitcoins after all,
because the errors in my records would
invalidate my win.
By invalidating my win, you gain more time
to guess the correct answer to the mathematical puzzle,
increasing the chance that @emph{you} would win.
So you would @emph{want} to betray me ---
and that makes it hard for the miners to cooperate.''

Marco smiled.

@sp 2

``Hmm,'' said Cheers, "I suppose you're right.
But suppose I were to hack your computer,
or, hmm, let's say I point a gun to your head.
I could force you to cooperate with me,
winner of the bitcoin jackpot or not!''

``Well,'' said Marco, ''that's correct.
But you can't point a gun at every
bitcoin miner @emph{in the world}.
You'd need to coerce at least half
of the bitcoin miners
all over the world,
because the decision to award or not award
newly-minted bitcoins to the winner
of the mathematical puzzle
is done by what is essentially a democratic vote.
It's another theoretically possible
but practiceally unfeasible attack,
called the `fifty-one percent attack,'
as it requires you to gain control
over more than half the miners.
The bitcoin system is thus very secure,
and that security, that strength,
is derived from numbers.''

@sp 2

``Fascinating,'' said Cheers.

Marco smiled again.
``Well, any more questions about bitcoin?''

There were none.

@sp 2

There were no more questions about Marco himself,
either.

``Thank you, my good roommate Marco,'' said Cheers,
amidst the clapping of their other roommates.
``Next, then ---
Damian Carlo ex Mantis?''

@node The Hacker
@chapter The Hacker

Marco climbed back into his bunk in relief,
as Damian stood up in his place
to deliver his own Self-Introduction.

Damian shrugged, then said,
``Damian Carlo ex Mantis,
from R1.
Programmer.''

Damian just stood there,
not saying anything further,
so Cheers prompted,
``Can you tell us more about your family?''

``Computer equipment importers,''
said Damian,
an absent, faraway look
on his face.
``Typical heteronormative parents,
a father and a mother.
Older sister's married,
also R1.
Cognitivist,
her husband works for Blimp Tourisms,
middle-level manager.''

Damian acted as if he'd completed
everything he wanted to say
for Self-Introduction.
As Cheers struggled
to find a better prompt,
Marco spoke,
his voice tinged with annoyance.

``Well, can you tell us more
about programming,
at least?'' he said.

At this, a wide, feral grin lit up
Damian's features,
sweeping away his blank look.

@sp 2

``I started programming when I was ten.
Been programming for six years.
My parents run a computer equipment business.
Used to play games on the computers,
then I stumbled on a programming tutorial
for kids.
Started programming, following the tutorial.
Wrote some simple games to play with.
I found that I had more fun
writing the games
than actually playing them.
Started to stay up late,
just to program.
When my parents imposed a lights-out time,
I would wake up a little after midnight
to sneak some time on the computers.
That started my programming obsession.''

Cheers beamed.
``That's good ---''

``--- Began looking for
more tutorials
and programming articles
on the internet,''
said Damian,
as if Cheers hadn't
already started speaking.
Damian had paused only
to gather breath, apparently.
``Started working on
the more advanced stuff.
Might have ended there, actually,
once I started getting to my limits.
But then came the turning point.''

Damian paused again.

``I started participating
in online communities.
Engaging the programming community.
On the internet,
no one knows
you're not even a teenager yet.
In a programming community,
nobody even @emph{cares}
what age you are.
There's only two things
that are important.
That you build good code,
and that you're not a jerk with others.
And if you got
really really @emph{really}
good code?
Some people will tolerate
you being a jerk anyway.
As a programmer
participating in
a free or open source project,
there's only two criteria
for legitimacy:
good code,
and working with the community.''

The others let Damian ramble on.

``And I'm glad that
free and open source software exists.
So what if I probably won't get
ridiculously rich programming,
like Bill Gates
in the late twentieth century?
If some generous people
hadn't given away
the software source code for free
in the first place,
then there would be no
free and open source software community
in the first place.
And if there was no programming community,
then there wouldn't be any
free and open source
programming tutorials and articles.
And if there weren't any
free programming tutorials,
I wouldn't have stumbled
on that first, beginner's programming tutorial.
I wouldn't have discovered programming at all.
I would have completely missed
being a programmer.
And I can't imagine what it would be like,
me not being a programmer.
So I give my own software,
my own source code,
so that others, too,
can discover and cultivate
their inherent skill.''

@sp 2

There was a long pause,
which Marco thought
meant that Damian had finished.
