@node The End of Childhood
@chapter The End of Childhood

Only three of their parents would be able to attend
the Seedling initiation of
Marco de Alugbati and Stephanie de Alugbati.
One of their fathers, Redemptor Alugbati or Daddy Red,
was currently assigned to the sea fertilization pumps.
Redemptor had offered to pull some strings
to swap his assigned shift ---
the family had quite a bit of influence, after all,
given the family business ---
but this was overruled by the other adults in the family.
The four Alugbati parents took pride in public service.

Marco de Alugbati woke up early.

As he started to gain wakefulness,
he realized that his heartbeat was speeding up.
He hadn't been able to sleep early last night, either.
After all, this was the last day he would be de Alugbati.

The officially-sanctioned knapsack lay on the bunk
beside his head.
It contained all the personal belongings
assigned to him.

As he got up, he realized that his sister's bunk was
already empty,
and that the bunk was already properly @emph{made}.
He got up and started to make his own bed,
and prepare for today.

@sp 2

The government-issued clothes in his knapsack
felt stiff and pinched his skin a little,
but he was not allowed to wear anything else
to the Seedling initiation ---
or even to bring anything other than himself,
the knapsack, and the contents of the knapsack,
as issued.
No Seedling could be allowed an unfair advantage,
and if his parents had been so inclined,
they could give him
a very, very unfair advantage indeed.

They were also very, very unlikely to be so inclined.

The clothes were a simple white shirt
and knee-length pants,
with corresponding underwear and socks.
They looked similar to his school uniform,
which had been returned to the school
several days ago.

He rummaged through his knapsack again,
knowing that there could be nothing extra there,
but he still persisted irrationally in checking.
The computation pad, 3D-printed personal items,
medikit, choline supplements,
notebook and pencil, sets of clothes...

@sp 2

He'd woken up early, but his parents and sister,
it turned out, had woken up even earlier.
The table was already set,
his older sister Stephanie and Mommy Lizet
were already sitting down waiting for breakfast,
which Mommy Maria was helping Daddy Mike to cook.

Their two younger siblings, Rudy and Rayne,
were probably still sleeping;
they had school today,
and in any case were not allowed to witness
the Seedling initiation ceremony.

Well, perhaps Mommy Lizet,
with her half-lidded eyes,
was not yet actually completely awake either.

Stephanie was fidgeting, which worried Marco a little,
but then he reflected on his own racing heart
and his dry mouth.
She was, quite likely, nervous just like him ---
or maybe excited would fit her personality more.
Marco wondered how she would say goodbye
to her boyfriends;
none of those he knew about were old enough
to be part of this year's Seedling initation.

``Good morning,'' said Stephanie.

``Good morning,'' said Marco.

Daddy Mike and Mommy Maria
looked up from the frying fish,
and chorused a ``Good morning;''
Mommy Lizet remained sitting upright
for a while,
then turned to him and murmured a slurred
``Good morning.''

``We heard your sister messing up the kitchen
so early in the morning,''
said Daddy Mike.
``She said she was @emph{really} hungry,
she hadn't slept well,
so I thought we'd have an early breakfast
and leave before
your little brother and little sister
go to school.
I guess my little sweets are old enough
to take care
of getting ready for today.
I'll just leave breakfast for them.''

``Please give Lizet her coffee,'' said Mommy Maria,
handing it to Marco,
``you know how she is in the mornings.
We'd planned on bringing you later
so that Rayne and Rudy could say goodbye properly,
but your sister's so excited.
I'll have to re-explain later to Lizet
why we're changing plans
once she gets her brain properly working.''

Marco placed the cup in front of Mommy Lizet,
then put his knapsack in his chair.

``I'll...'' he started, then he cleared his throat.
``I'll just go outside a bit.''

``You're not going to eat breakfast?'' asked Stephanie.
``You're even more excited than I am!''

``I'll eat breakfast when it's ready,'' he said.
``I just need some fresh air right now.''

He opened the door of the common room to the outside
and stepped on the deck of their homeboat.
He walked over to the public-use part of their deck,
connected by pontoon bridges to other homeboats.

His parents' homeboat and his parents' deck,
he corrected himself mentally.

He looked at their neigbors' homeboats,
looked up at the dark blue sky,
and looked at the brightening to the east.
He breathed in the salt breeze of the sea a few times,
to build up his strength.

This was the day he had been anticipating and dreading.

After a particularly big breath,
he let out a whoop with all his strength
in the direction of the dawning sun.

@sp 2

``What was that for?'' said Stephanie
as he re-entered the common room.
His parents were all grinning at him
as they sat around the central table,
even Mommy Lizet.

``Sorry,'' said Marco, taking his seat
and smelling the fried fish.
``I just had to let it out.''

``@emph{You're} more excited than I am,'' she said.

``You're the one who woke up all our parents early
and made them change their plans.''

``Yeah, you're just the one
who woke up all our @emph{neighbors} early,
and made them change @emph{all} their plans,
most likely.''

Marco shrugged.  ``Yeah, I guess.
I don't really know what got into me.
I just wanted some air, and then I couldn't help it,
I just wanted to shout.''

Stephanie rolled her eyes.  ``And you're supposed
to be the one with all that @emph{self-control}.''

``Doesn't mean I have an infinite amount of self-control,
and that was just according to the results
of the standard test they give everyone at five years old,''
said Marco.

He took a fish and then noticed something else on the table.
``Carbo bars?''

``Today's a special day,'' said Daddy Mike,
looking up from the common room's computation pad,
which he was fiddling with.
``You both need lots of energy.  Anyway...
we've been trying to connect to your Daddy Red,
but I guess he's still sleeping.
Ah, there he is.''
He set up the pad in its location
at the end of the common room table,
where they could all see it and be seen by its camera.

``What's up?'' said Daddy Red.
The video was dark,
but his bleary eyes were obvious.
``Why so early?  It's five in the morning.''

``Oh, nothing,'' said Daddy Mike.
``We just promised to ekiga you
before we brought the kids
to the Seedling initiation.
So we're calling now,
since Steph and Marco are so excited,
they want to go soon.''

``Not really, dad,'' said Stephanie.
``I was planning for a midnight snack,
or rather an early-morning snack,
but I knocked down some pans
and that woke Daddy Mike up.''
She then whisperred loudly, winking,
``You know, I think Daddy Mike wasn't
actually @emph{sleeping} at all,
he was just waiting for an excuse to get up.
Because he's the most excited of us all.''
She then smiled innocently at Daddy Mike,
batting her eyelashes.

Daddy Red laughed.
``Yeah, that does sound like your Daddy Mike.
You know how deep he sleeps normally.
I've dropped pans while cheating an early-morning snack
and @emph{he} never woke up to make me breakfast!''

``You know that's not true, Redemptor,'' said Daddy Mike,
his faced flushed.
Mommy Maria, Daddy Red, and Stephanie laughed.

``Oh, and guess what?'' said Mommy Maria.
``So Stephanie got up early and woke us all up.
You know what your son Marco did, when he got up?
He went outside and woke all our neighbors up!''

``What?'' said Daddy Red.

``No I didn't!'' Marco objected.
``I just whooped once!''

``It was a really big shout,
I'm sure they heard it all the way
up to Rationality One,''
said Stephanie.

``What did Marco do?'' said Daddy Red.

``Nothing really, I just went outside
for a good breath of fresh air
while waiting for breakfast,
then I just whooped once!''

Daddy Mike, Daddy Red, Mommy Maria and Stephanie laughed.
Even Mommy Lizet smiled through the fog of drowsiness.

Marco sighed, digging into breakfast.

``Why don't you eat breakfast too?''
Daddy Mike asked Daddy Red.

``Canteen's probably not open yet,'' said Daddy Red.
``And I'll probably go back to sleep when you go.''

``How about you, Lizet?'' said Daddy Mike.

``Just coffee, sweetheart,'' said Mommy Lizet.

``Just coffee isn't healty, sweets,'' said Daddy Mike.
``It'll be a tiring day for all of us.''

``My brain isn't working yet, so it cannot possibly verify
the validity of that statement, so just give me the coffee,
sweetheart.''

``It's been right in front you since Marco put it there,
Lizet,'' said Mommy Maria.

``I'm going to need more.  A lot more.
I feel so sleepy today, sleepier than usual.
What time is it anyway?''

``Have a carbo bar at least,'' said Daddy Mike, offering one,
which Mommy Lizet took, dipping it into the coffee.
``It's about a quarter after five.''

``Why are we up so early?  I thought we would eat breakfast
after Rudy and Rayne leave for school?''

Mommy Maria grinned.  ``Because Stephanie woke up really early.
And now Marco's awake too.
They're excited to begin the Seedling initiation,
so Mike and I decided to bring them early.
I probably need to record this explanation because
that's the third time you asked that question this morning.''

``Really?''

Stephanie giggled.  Mommy Lizet absently patted her hand.

``Why don't we wake Rudy and Rayne up?'' asked Marco.
``I know it's early and the schoolboat
won't pass here until seven thirty,
but at least we can say goodbye personally.''

``They were up late last night doing school projects,''
said Daddy Mike.  ``Let them sleep.
Waking them up is bad for their health.''

``It's just one day, dad,'' said Marco.

``That's what I told him, too,'' said Mommy Maria.

``Marco and Steph can just write notes for them.
And kiss them but don't wake them.''

``Nothing's as good as saying goodbye in person,''
said Stephanie.  ``Or at least by ekiga,'' she added,
winking at Daddy Red, who smiled back.

Daddy Mike grumbled.  ``Fine, then.
But finish your breakfast first,
my little sweets will want to eat when they get up
and we don't have enough seats here.''

``Anyway,'' said Daddy Red, ``the reason I wanted
to ekiga you before you left, is, well, Mike?''

``Uh, yes, Red.  Sweets, you have to wake up @emph{now},''
Daddy Mike told Mommy Lizet, poking her.

Mommy Lizet drank the rest of her coffee
in a single gulp.
She blinked, then breathed deeply.
``Children --- Stephanie, Marco --- today is your
Seedling initiation.  When you enter the Seedling boats,
you'll stop being de Alugbati, and become ex Alugbati.
And later when you form families of your own,
you'll pick a new family name for your own family.''

Her eyes drifted back into sleepiness.
Marco almost wanted to laugh at this,
but he guessed that this was a solemn leavetaking.

Stephanie grinned at it, though.

``So starting today,'' said Daddy Mike, ``you don't have to call
us `mom' or `dad' anymore.  Today, you'll start becoming adults.
A year from today, you'll officially be adults.
And then, you shall be equal in standing,
in the eyes of our laws and our culture, to us.''

``We hope you become upstanding, successful, and public-minded citizens,''
said Daddy Red, ``of whatever platform you choose to call your home.
We hope that you remember this:
for fifteen years, you were of the Alugbati family,
and we have always strived to instill the values
that we believe are necessary,
for the success of an individual,
for the success of a family,
and for the success of a sea platform.''

``And for the success of all of humanity,'' said Mommy Maria.
``Perhaps some day you too shall have children,
which you too shall send off as Seedlings
when they grow to this age.
And you too will know this:
that you love your children,
that you will want to protect them and to guide them,
and that the best thing to do is to let them go
and make their own path.''

``We love you,'' said Daddy Mike.
Their other parents nodded in agreement.

There was a moment of silence.

Marco forced himself to speak.  ``I love you too,''
he said.  Then, tentatively, ``Mike, and Red, and Fara
Lizet, and Maria --- I love you too.''

``I love you too, moms, dads,'' said Stephanie.
``I know we don't @emph{have} to call you that anymore
but you didn't say we have to @emph{not} call you that ---
so I'm going to call you that.  Is that okay?''

Their parents chuckled.
``I think it's okay with us, if you really want to,''
said Redemptor.

``Thanks,'' said Stephanie.  ``I really want to.
I'm really happy.  And nervous, and excited.
Thank you, moms, dads.''

@node The Walk of the Seedlings
@chapter The Walk of the Seedlings

Rudy and Rayne waved them off
as Marco and Stephanie crossed the threshold
between the private and public-use areas of the deck.

``Remember to e-mail us!'' said Rayne.

``We will!'' said Stephanie.

``Of course we will,'' said Marco.

``Take care!  Make sure to come back
and give us lots of money!
You know how tightwad Daddy Mike is!''
said Rudy.

``I heard that, Rudy,'' said Michael Alugbati.
Rudy stuck out his tongue at his father.

``So,'' said Marco, as they stepped off
their parents' homeboat
onto a pontoon connected to their neighbor,
``do we get a taxi?''

``No,'' said Michael, ``traditionally,
Seedlings are supposed to walk from their ex-homes
to the Seedling launch location.''

``But @emph{dad},'' said Stephanie,
``that can't be a tradition,
the Seedling initiations were started
just ten years ago,
this is just the fourth Seedling initiation,
there's not enough time for there
to be a tradition like that!''

``Sounds like just the right time
to start a tradition to me,''
said Michael.

``Wouldn't walking be fundamentally unfair?''
said Marco.
``I mean, some Seedlings would start farther
from the Seedling launch site than others.
Isn't the intent of the Seedling initiation
supposed to be to give an equal start to all
R1 and R2 teenagers?''

``It's not as if being tired
on this particular day
would have that big an effect
on your future.''

``But it @emph{could},'' said Stephanie.
``We'd be too tired to talk properly
to our roommates during Self-Introduction,
which could make us appear to be less valuable
as allies later on,
thus making us less actually valued by our peers
and greatly reducing our chance
of becoming successful.''

Michael just sighed loudly.

``Stop teasing your dad, sweethearts,''
said Fara Elizabeth Alugbati.
``Or your ex-dad, as your choice may be.
In any case, you won't have any access to money
until you get on the Seedling boats,
and we're not going to spring any to pay
for a taxi.''

``What if we memorized the private key
to the family wallet?'' asked Marco.

``Then accessing it after we kicked you
out of our homeboat would be stealing,
sweetheart,'' said Lizet.
``That is punishable by the laws
of pretty much every platform of Sea State.
The Alugbati family affiliates as a citizen of R1,
which most definitely has stealing as an illegal act,
and you would be punished
whatever the jurisdiction you decide to live under.
Starting this day you are viewed by the state of R1
and the various R2 platforms
as prospective adults.
You would then be treated as adults
if you access the property, without permission,
of an R1-affiliated citizen.''

``We lack sleep, Daddy Mike,'' said Stephanie.
``It's unhealthy to walk all the way to
Rationality One in this state,
hopping onto different pontoons and homeboats.
We might slip due to drowsiness and drown.
How could we be successful that way?''

Michael just sighed again.  Maria, Lizet, Stephanie,
and Marco just laughed and hugged him.

@sp 2

Their route required them to pass through
the public-use area of Lancer ex Caballeros' homeboat.
The two fully adult women almost had to drag
Michael off of the pontoon onto the deck
of the infamously eccentric old man's homeboat.

Marco stared at one of the reasons
for Michael's reluctance ---
a large sign on Lancer's private deck
with the following slogans:

@display
Strength from Diversity
Diversity from Tolerance
Tolerance from Understanding
Understanding from Rationality
@end display

A thickset, white-haired man
emerged onto the homeboat's private deck
and waved to them.
As usual, he was wearing his naval uniform,
emblazoned with advertisements from the sponsors
of his old navy.
Seeing him, Michael forced a pleasant smile
on his face and nodded in greeting.

``Good morning, neighbors!'' said Lancer.
``Hello, children.  Or I suppose you are Seedlings, now?''

``Sir, yes, sir, ex-admiral sir!'' said Stephanie,
smiling.

Lancer stood at attention and saluted.
``Succeed, Seedlings!
And remember that you're the future of R1 and all the R2's.
And if you can't decide on what to do with your life,
well, there's the navy!
Look up the Sea Strikers, or our siblings-in-arms,
the Ocean Hunters!''

Marco and Stephanie saluted in response,
then laughed and waved goodbye
to the eccentric retired navyman.

Michael, the last to step onto Lancer's homeboat,
was the first to hop onto the pontoon connecting it
to the next homeboat.

@sp 2

``It's illegal, that's what it is,'' said Michael.

``Just let it go, Mike,'' said Maria.
``He's just a harmless, eccentric old man,
all the kids like him,
they like hearing his stories of patrolling the high seas
and fighting sea pirates.''

``They haven't finished debating the merits and demerits
of that set of slogans,'' said Michael.
``He should keep it on R2 where the politics is done.
He could have just settled down on one of the R2 platforms
after retirement.
We'll vote for the slogans, or not vote for them,
after the R2's have finished their debates.
Let @emph{them} be the ones to subject their families
to the cutting edge of sociopolitical structures!
We chose R1 so that we could live in stability.
And all those advertisements!
On his clothes, on his deck, on top of his cabin,
he probably has them on his underwear.''

``You know how much he loves his old navy, sweetheart,''
said Lizet.
``He arranged for them to update him with
the current advertisements of their sponsors
and he puts them on his boat.
On the private part of his boat,
so that's not really any of our business.''

``The man's right to throw around garish photons ends
where my retina begins.''

``Now, Mike,'' said Maria,
``Remember, `Strength through Diversity.'
It takes all kinds of people to make a society.
And our own homeboat isn't pretty, either,
with all those weird things
Lizet and Red keep making
to get more electrical power
for the bitcoin mining rigs.''

``Bah, don't quote them to me!
I don't like hearing them.
It'll bias me when the R2 debates end
and R1 has to vote on whether to accept or reject them.''

Maria shrugged.  ``I don't know why Mike hates Lance so much,''
she whispered to Lizet.

``Oh, and you quoted it wrong,'' Michael added.
``It's `Strength @emph{from} Diversity,' not `through'.''

Behind his back, Lizet, Maria, Marco, and Stephanie
grinned at each other.

@sp 2

After a while, they realized that the route
they had chosen was broken.
Some homeboat had undocked from the pontoons,
and the gap was much too large to jump easily.
Michael and Lizet brought out their
personal computation pads to check the maps.

``It's still registered as being there,''
said Lizet.

``But it's not there, obviously, sweets ---''
Michael started to say.

``Just as obviously, sweetheart, it moved just today,
maybe not even an hour ago,
since the online map hasn't updated yet.
Maybe they have Seedlings to bring
to the Seedling initiation
and decided to bring their entire homeboat.''

Michael snorted.  ``Tragedy of the commons,''
he said.  ``If everyone did that,
there'd be too many homeboats clogging the area
around Rationality One each Seedling initiation.''

``I could just throw them across the gap,''
Maria offerred, flexing her muscles.

``Mom!'' the two Seedlings chorused.

``And toss all of you, too,'' said Maria.

``And who would toss you?'' said Michael.

``You could go on without me,'' said Maria.
``Go!  Run!  Before the Seedling boats leave the docks!
Run and chase your destiny, my Seedlings!''
she continued, in mock drama.

``We shall never forget your great sacrifice, dear mother!''
said Marco, laughing.

``Sweethearts, stop fooling around,'' said Lizet.
``Here's a new route with that boat made unpassable.
We'll just backtrack a little and go through that
pontoon bridge instead,'' she pointed.

``Or we could call that taxi over there,
my feet hurt already,'' said Stephanie.
``This knapsack's heavy.''

``Challenges make you stronger,'' said Michael.
``Let's go.''

``Wrong, dad, it goes
`what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.'
All this walking is killing me,
so walking can't make me stronger!''

Michael ignored her.

``Wait, I have a better idea,'' said Stephanie.
``Marco could carry me and my knapsack!''

``Definitely not, Steph,
you've been gaining weight recently,'' said Marco.

``I'm not, and you know it!'' said Stephanie.
``I know, I'll just call one of my boyfriends
and have him treat me to a taxi ride
to Rationality One.''

``Steph,'' Michael said, ``do you want to enjoy
these last few moments you'll have
with your parents before you go
on a one-year trip of self-discovery, or not?''

Stephanie's grin fell.  ``I want to be with you,''
she said.  ``I'm sorry.''

``Let's go and @emph{walk}, then.''

After a while,
Stephanie ran up to Michael and hugged him.
``Sorry, dad,'' she said.
``But I suddenly realized that these are also
the last moments I'll have
to tease you personally!''

@sp 2

The Alugbatis encountered
more and more families with their Seedlings
as they approached the ship Rationality One.
Marco could son make out a queue of Seedlings,
in their plain white, government-issued shirts,
on the deck of the converted warship.

A ramp led from a pontoon to that part of the ship.
An official stood at the lower end,
allowing only Seedlings to pass through.
A small crowd of well-wishing parents stood around her,
watching their Seedlings as they waited in line
for their ship assignments.

``Welcome to Rationality One,'' said Maria.
``This is where our walk ends.''

Marco and Stephanie started hugging their parents.

Lizet hugged Marco and kissed him.
Marco felt her press a small, flat and round
metallic object into his hand.
Then she whispered, ``this may be useful to you soon.''

When he looked at her in surprise, she whispered,
``Go west, sweetheart, and use this for the benefit
of all of humanity.''

He pocketed it, hoping nobody noticed.
He recognized it from its shape and composition.

His heart pounding, he approached the official
and gave her his papers,
hoping that he wasn't obviously sweating
and that his polite smile didn't look fake.
He rushed up the ramp when she let him pass.

It was something that gave him an unfair advantage.
It was something he never expected his parents
to give him, not as a Seedling.

It was a physical bitcoin.

@node The Seedling Counselor
@chapter The Seedling Counselor

``Marco de Alugbati,'' said the man behind the desk,
in a tiny government office onboard
the de facto government center Rationality One,
after Marco gave him the Seedling acceptance letter.
Behind the man was a poster of a pair of staring eyes.
``Genetic child of Redemptor and Fara Elizabeth Alugbati,
registered child of Redemptor, Fara Elizabeth, Maria,
and Michael Alugbati.''

``Yes, sir,'' said Marco.

``I'm Ricardo,'' the man said.
``Cognitivist Ricardo Derrick,
but just call me Ricardo.
I'm your Seedling counselor,
and I will conduct a short interview with you.
Then you will be evaluated and,
if deemed acceptable,
your name will be formally changed from
Marco de Alugbati to Marco ex Alugbati.
Are you ready?''

``Yes, Ricardo,'' said Marco.

``Good,'' said Ricardo, tapping on the keyboard
on his desk, not meeting his gaze.  ``Let's begin.''

Ricardo asked Marco a series of simple,
objective questions;
the cognitivist focused intently
on the computer screen.

``What's your age?''  ``Fifteen years and a month.''
``Have you completed basic education?'' ``Yes.''
``Have you completed intermediate education?'' ``Yes.''
``Have you completed basic rationality training?'' ``Yes.''
``How often do you socialize with friends?''  ``About once a week.''
...

And then the question that made Marco slip.

``Are you carrying anything other than the standard-issue
Seedling knapsack?''

Marco could almost say ``No.''  But, involuntarily,
his eyes met the staring eyes on the poster for a moment.
It made him pause.

Ricardo looked at him.  ``So, Marco,'' he said,
``you @emph{are} carrying something extra, aren't you?''

Marco nodded.
He felt the blood rush to his face,
and found himself
unable to meet Ricardo's eyes.

``A neat trick, isn't it?'' said Ricardo.
``Those eyes behind me, I mean.
Old cognitivist's trick.
While interviewing you we are not suppoed
to look directly at you,
as that would bias our judgment.
But seeing eyes stare at you forces you
to be honest.
And those unblinking, perenially staring eyes
up there force you to be very, very honest.''

Marco said nothing.

``That's strange,'' said Ricardo,
looking up something on his computer.
``You are listed as having surprisingly high
self-control, at least when you were five years old.
And you're de Alugbati.
Your parents are famous
for taking our laws and customs very seriously,
and for being extremely concerned about, and I quote,
`giving our rightful share for the advancement of society.'
I wouldn't have thought that you would bring
anything other than the items that were issued to you.
So what, exactly, are you bringing in?''

Marco fumbled for the coin in his pocket.
He showed it to Ricardo,
the placed it on the desk.

``What is it?'' Ricardo asked, frowning.

``It's a Casascius physical bitcoin,'' said Marco.
``It has a face value of twenty-five bitcoins,
as you see here under the big bitcoin symbol.
The `vires in numeris'
on the left side of the bitcoin symbol
means `strength in numbers,'
and is meaningful at several levels.
The number `2011'
on the right side is the year of minting.
Here on the flip side of the coin
is the tamper-resistant hologram label;
the eight printed characters in the center
are the first eight characters
identifying a bitcoin wallet
supposedly containing the face value amount.
Peeling off the hologram label will reveal
a small card containing the private key
that allows access to the bitcoin wallet,
and there is no conventional method
of returning the label afterwards.
This coin appears to be untampered,
although you should realize that less than a decade
after this coin was released,
enthusiasts had already found a way
to extract the card
without the tampering being evident.
Minting of this particular series of coin
was stopped almost immediately.
Currently, most of its value is actually
in its collectibility;
many collectors consider the face value
to be essentially zero,
and it is the coin itself,
being of limited minting,
that is valued.
I'd estimate it to be worth about
a hundred bitcoins
at an antiques shop today,
and a collector might be willing
to go as high as a hundred fifty bitcoins for it.''

Ricardo blinked.

``Mr. de Alugbati,'' Ricardo said,
``your family's business is bitcoin mining.
I must confess that as a cognitivist,
I only use bitcoins for receiving my salary
and paying for things.
Private keys, wallets ---
can you explain them to me?''

Marco nodded.  ``Well,
I suppose you have a bank account somewhere,
probably at R1 Bank?''

``Yes.''

``Now, a bank account is just
a name attached to a number,
the number being the amount of cash you own.
Your bank account is, of course,
protected by a personal identification number
or PIN, correct?''

``Correct.''

``So a bank account is just a name,
attached to a number, protected by a PIN.
Now, imagine the bitcoin system
as a giant, worldwide bank.''

``I don't see how the bitcoins system
would work like a bank.''

``Well, a bank is just a set of bank accounts, right?
And a bank account is just a record containing the name,
the current balance, and the PIN.
At the simplest and most naive level,
you could implement a bank as a set of index cards.
The bitcoin system is just a very special method
of storing that information on very many computers
over the Internet, with lots of encryption to ensure
that the none of the computers can be programmed
to cheat.''

``I see.''

``Think of each wallet as a `bank account,' associating a name ---
or rather, what we call the `public key' of the wallet ---
with a number, the number being the balance of bitcoins
in that wallet.
We use the public key instead of a name,
to allow anonymity ---
much like a numbered Swiss bank account.
The bank account is protected by the `private key,'
which is something like a PIN protecting the bank account.''

``Ah,'' said Ricardo, ``so this physical bitcoin is something
like a bank access card with the PIN written on it.''

``Yes, although the PIN is hidden by a tamper-resistant label.''

``How would I use it?''

``Well, one way of paying another person would be
to open an anonymous numbered bank account,
deposit the needed amount of money,
write the PIN on the bank access card,
then wrap the bank access card in a tamper-proof package
and give it to the other person.
The person would then be able to open the tamper-proof
package to withdraw the money.
Or alternately, he or she could pass it, still wrapped,
as payment to a third person,
who could further pass it to a fourth, and so on.''

``It doesn't seem to be very practical to me.''

``Well, creating a new bitcoin wallet is much easier
than opening an anonymous numbered bank account,
but you're correct, it is relatively impractical.
If both you and the other person have an account
in the same bank,
it's far easier to just transfer the amount
between your accounts.
And that's what a payment
in the bitcoin system actually is:
an inter-account transfer.
The impractical nature of these coins meant
that they were more of a publicity stunt
for the bitcoin system;
their impracticability is the reason for why
they had limited minting.
But today, the value of the coin is driven
by the historic nature of the coin
as an early publicity stunt
at a time when bitcoin was considered a passing fad,
and the limited minting of these coins.
It is valuable because it is impractical.''

Ricardo smiled.  ``Ironic, I suppose.
The value you just quoted me ---
a hundred bitcoins ---
is too large for me to overlook.
But knowing your family, a hundred bitcoins
wouldn't be much to them.
If I had been asked to imagine your parents
giving you something valuable,
something that would give you
an advantage over your peers,
I would have imagined them giving you
at least a thousand bitcoins,
and I'd probably seriously consider
ten times that.
They donated a thousand bitcoins
for this year's Seedling fund,
so anything they'd give to you
would have to match that.
And to risk this kind of scandal,
to only give you a hundred bitcoins...''
Ricardo shook his head.
``This was given to you by your parents?''

``Yes,'' said Marco.  ``Mommy Lizet ---
Fara Elizabeth Alugbati ---
gave it to me.
Just a little while ago.''

``Very strange.''
Ricardo rubbed his lips,
his forehead knotted.
``The value of this coin would be sufficient grounds
for me to cancel your Seedling acceptance letter
and have you discreetly sent back home.
But no matter how discreet it would be,
someone would know that you were caught trying to cheat.
Your parents would lose significant influence
once word of this leaks out,
and you would find your Seedling initiation delayed
until the next initiation.''

Ricardo leaned back in his chair.
``Did she tell you anything about it?''

``Well, all she told me was that
I might find it useful, and to go west
and help humanity.''

Ricardo raised his eyebrows,
but otherwise said nothing for a long while.

@sp 2

``Sir?'' asked Marco, ``does this mean that
I have to go...?''

``Can you try to remember exactly
what she told you?''  Ricardo said,
as if Marco hadn't asked a question.

``Uh... It went something like:
`You might find it useful soon.
Go west, sweetheart, and use this
to benefit all humanity.'
That's all I remember.''

Ricardo picked up the coin
and held it out to Marco.

``Take it.  I'm going out on a limb
and say that you never mentioned this,
and I trust that you will not
mention the coin to anyone,
until the time you need to use it.
Go on, take it.''

Puzzled, Marco took the coin.
At the brief touch,
he realized that Ricardo's hand was shaking.

``So she said `go west,' did she?'' asked Ricardo.
``Thank you for telling me.
There are --- some organizations, part of Sea State,
with particular code words and phrases.
Your parents are an important contact point
for one of those organizations.
As part of a --- common code ---
`go west' has a particular meaning.
It means: `prepare for imminent war.'
Your parents have just sounded a warning,
and used you, and most likely your sister,
to transmit that warning
to the central government of R1
and its associated sea platforms.''

``My parents are @emph{spies}?''

``Information processing nodes, actually.
Spymasters, not spies.''

Marco could not think of a proper reaction
to this revelation.

Ricardo smiled.
``Your parents are known to be very clever.
Especially Red and Lizet.
If you had managed to pass through this interview
without mentioning the coin,
then you would have accepted their advice
at the literal level.
Which means that you would, literally,
want to go west from R1.
So I suggest that you continue to follow the
literal meaning of the advice: go west.
Head west, and convince your fellow Seedlings
to head west.
Cross the South Pacific.
Head for the Dunbarite platforms, if you can.
And @emph{use} that coin.
I suspect its value is far, far more than a mere
one hundred bitcoins.''

@sp 2

``Here are the formal papers attesting to
your change of name and status
from child of the Alugbatis --- de Alugbati ---
to an adult that has left the Alugbatis ---
ex Alugbati.
This sealed envelope is your randomly-assigned
room number.
When you exit this room, turn right
and then open your room number envelope,
then board your assigned ship
and look for your assigned room on that ship.''

Marco took the offered papers, but remained seated.
``Ricardo, I'm sorry, but this has been so fast ---
I was expecting to be sent home,
shamed for trying to smuggle in a physical bitcoin.
Now you're telling me I can go?''

``Son, what you just told me means that we will be
a lot less strict about what the Seedlings are
allowed to bring on board.
The Alugbatis have sounded the alarm.
We may need to consider evacuating R1 and the R2's.
Right now, getting you and your fellow Seedlings out there
takes higher priority than
merely ensuring fairness.
Go, Seedling, and keep that coin safe!''

@sp 2

When Marco finally mustered enough self-awareness
to stand and leave, he turned right and walked a little,
then stopped.

He stood there for a moment, looking behind him.

Another Seedling exited from an adjacent office,
running past Marco.
Another Seedling then walked up from the waiting
area on a lower deck, and entered that office.
Then another Seedling exited another counselor's office,
jumping in joy, and soon another one entered timidly
into that office.

For a long while,
nobody entered Ricardo Derrick's office
after Marco left it.

@sp 2

As if in a dream, he opened the sealed envelope.

Seedling boat 3, room number 2.

He stood, staring at the paper.  He felt light and dizzy.
Everything around him felt somehow unreal and impossible.
He wondered whether to continue onward or turn back.

If war was imminent, wouldn't it be better
to be with his family?
With Rudy and Rayne and Daddy Mike and Mommy Lizet and
Mommy Maria and Daddy Red?

Then, with a deep breath, he continued in the direction
that Ricardo had indicated.

Sara ex Mulligan waited, in her old tub of a homeboat,
beside the newly 3D-printed hull of this year's
Seedling boat 3.
Her fellow Gardener, Renee Magnus,
should be arriving soon.
