@node The End of Childhood
@chapter The End of Childhood

Only three of their parents would be able to attend
the Seedling initiation of
Marco de Alugbati and Stephanie de Alugbati.
One of their fathers, Redemptor Alugbati or Daddy Red,
was currently assigned to the sea fertilization pumps.
Redemptor had offered to pull some strings
to swap his assigned shift ---
the family had quite a bit of influence, after all,
given the family business ---
but this was overruled by the other adults in the family.
The four Alugbati parents took pride in public service.

Marco de Alugbati woke up early.

As he started to gain wakefulness,
he realized that his heartbeat was speeding up.
He hadn't been able to sleep early last night, either.
After all, this was the last day he would be de Alugbati.

The officially-sanctioned knapsack lay on the bunk
beside his head.
It contained all the personal belongings
assigned to him.

As he got up, he realized that his sister's bunk was
already empty,
and that the bunk was already properly @emph{made}.
He got up and started to make his own bed,
and prepare for today.

@sp 2

The government-issued clothes in his knapsack
felt stiff and pinched his skin a little,
but he was not allowed to wear anything else
to the Seedling initiation ---
or even to bring anything other than himself,
the knapsack, and the contents of the knapsack,
as issued.
No Seedling could be allowed an unfair advantage,
and if his parents had been so inclined,
they could give him
a very, very unfair advantage indeed.

They were also very, very unlikely to be so inclined.

The clothes were a simple white shirt
and knee-length pants,
with corresponding underwear and socks.
They looked similar to his school uniform,
which had been returned to the school
several days ago.

He rummaged through his knapsack again,
knowing that there could be nothing extra there,
but he still persisted irrationally in checking.
The computation pad, 3D-printed personal items,
medikit, choline supplements,
notebook and pencil, sets of clothes...

@sp 2

He'd woken up early, but his parents and sister,
it turned out, had woken up even earlier.
The table was already set,
his older sister Stephanie and Mommy Lizet
were already sitting down waiting for breakfast,
which Mommy Maria was helping Daddy Mike to cook.

Their two younger siblings, Rudy and Rayne,
were probably still sleeping;
they had school today,
and in any case were not allowed to witness
the Seedling initiation ceremony.

Well, perhaps Mommy Lizet,
with her half-lidded eyes,
was not yet actually completely awake either.

Stephanie was fidgeting, which worried Marco a little,
but then he reflected on his own racing heart
and his dry mouth.
She was, quite likely, nervous just like him ---
or maybe excited would fit her personality more.
Marco wondered how she would say goodbye
to her boyfriends;
none of those he knew about were old enough
to be part of this year's Seedling initation.

``Good morning,'' said Stephanie.

``Good morning,'' said Marco.

Daddy Mike and Mommy Maria
looked up from the frying fish,
and chorused a ``Good morning;''
Mommy Lizet remained sitting upright
for a while,
then turned to him and murmured a slurred
``Good morning.''

``We heard your sister messing up the kitchen
so early in the morning,''
said Daddy Mike.
``She said she was @emph{really} hungry,
she hadn't slept well,
so I thought we'd have an early breakfast
and leave before
your little brother and little sister
go to school.
I guess my little sweets are old enough
to take care
of getting ready for today.
I'll just leave breakfast for them.''

``Please give Lizet her coffee,'' said Mommy Maria,
handing it to Marco,
``you know how she is in the mornings.
We'd planned on bringing you later
so that Rayne and Rudy could say goodbye properly,
but your sister's so excited.
I'll have to re-explain later to Lizet
why we're changing plans
once she gets her brain properly working.''

Marco placed the cup in front of Mommy Lizet,
then put his knapsack in his chair.

``I'll...'' he started, then he cleared his throat.
``I'll just go outside a bit.''

``You're not going to eat breakfast?'' asked Stephanie.
``You're even more excited than I am!''

``I'll eat breakfast when it's ready,'' he said.
``I just need some fresh air right now.''

He opened the door of the common room to the outside
and stepped on the deck of their homeboat.
He walked over to the public-use part of their deck,
connected by pontoon bridges to other homeboats.

His parents' homeboat and his parents' deck,
he corrected himself mentally.

His parents' homeboat,
connected to the other homeboats
of other families,
formed the `land' of the sea platform R1.
R1 was positioned
just outside Chile's national waters.
Far to the east, far beyond Rationality One,
would be the continent of South America.
The sea fertilization pumps
and the fisheries they supported
would be south.
To the west was the vast expanse of
the Pacific Ocean,
and further than that,
the other sea platforms of Sea State,
colloquially known as the Dunbarite platforms,
due to the rules those platforms followed.

He looked at their neigbors' homeboats,
looked up at the dark blue sky,
and looked at the brightening to the east.
He breathed in the salt breeze of the sea a few times,
to build up his strength.

This was the day he had been anticipating and dreading.

After a particularly big breath,
he let out a whoop with all his strength
in the direction of the dawning sun.

@sp 2

``What was that for?'' said Stephanie
as he re-entered the common room.
His parents were all grinning at him
as they sat around the central table,
even Mommy Lizet.

``Sorry,'' said Marco, taking his seat
and smelling the fried fish.
``I just had to let it out.''

``@emph{You're} more excited than I am,'' she said.

``You're the one who woke up all our parents early
and made them change their plans.''

``Yeah, you're just the one
who woke up all our @emph{neighbors} early,
and made them change @emph{all} their plans,
most likely.''

Marco shrugged.  ``Yeah, I guess.
I don't really know what got into me.
I just wanted some air, and then I couldn't help it,
I just wanted to shout.''

Stephanie rolled her eyes.  ``And you're supposed
to be the one with all that @emph{self-control}.''

``Doesn't mean I have an infinite amount of self-control,
and that was just according to the results
of the standard test they give everyone at five years old,''
said Marco.

He took a fish and then noticed something else on the table.
``Carbo bars?''

``Today's a special day,'' said Daddy Mike,
looking up from the common room's computation pad,
which he was fiddling with.
``You both need lots of energy.  Anyway...
we've been trying to connect to your Daddy Red,
but I guess he's still sleeping.
Ah, there he is.''
He set up the pad in its location
at the end of the common room table,
where they could all see it and be seen by its camera.

``What's up?'' said Daddy Red.
The video was dark,
but his bleary eyes were obvious.
``Why so early?  It's five in the morning.''

``Oh, nothing,'' said Daddy Mike.
``We just promised to ekiga you
before we brought the kids
to the Seedling initiation.
So we're calling now,
since Steph and Marco are so excited,
they want to go soon.''

``Not really, dad,'' said Stephanie.
``I was planning for a midnight snack,
or rather an early-morning snack,
but I knocked down some pans
and that woke Daddy Mike up.''
She then whisperred loudly, winking,
``You know, I think Daddy Mike wasn't
actually @emph{sleeping} at all,
he was just waiting for an excuse to get up.
Because he's the most excited of us all.''
She then smiled innocently at Daddy Mike,
batting her eyelashes.

Daddy Red laughed.
``Yeah, that does sound like your Daddy Mike.
You know how deep he sleeps normally.
I've dropped pans while cheating an early-morning snack
and @emph{he} never woke up to make me breakfast!''

``You know that's not true, Redemptor,'' said Daddy Mike,
his faced flushed.
Mommy Maria, Daddy Red, and Stephanie laughed.

``Oh, and guess what?'' said Mommy Maria.
``So Stephanie got up early and woke us all up.
You know what your son Marco did, when he got up?
He went outside and woke all our neighbors up!''

``What?'' said Daddy Red.

``No I didn't!'' Marco objected.
``I just whooped once!''

``It was a really big shout,
I'm sure they heard it all the way
up to Rationality One,''
said Stephanie.

``What did Marco do?'' said Daddy Red.

``Nothing really, I just went outside
for a good breath of fresh air
while waiting for breakfast,
then I just whooped once!''

Daddy Mike, Daddy Red, Mommy Maria and Stephanie laughed.
Even Mommy Lizet smiled through the fog of drowsiness.

Marco sighed, digging into breakfast.

``Why don't you eat breakfast too?''
Daddy Mike asked Daddy Red.

``Canteen's probably not open yet,'' said Daddy Red.
``And I'll probably go back to sleep when you go.''

``How about you, Lizet?'' said Daddy Mike.

``Just coffee, sweetheart,'' said Mommy Lizet.

``Just coffee isn't healty, sweets,'' said Daddy Mike.
``It'll be a tiring day for all of us.''

``My brain isn't working yet, so it cannot possibly verify
the validity of that statement, so just give me the coffee,
sweetheart.''

``It's been right in front you since Marco put it there,
Lizet,'' said Mommy Maria.

``I'm going to need more.  A lot more.
I feel so sleepy today, sleepier than usual.
What time is it anyway?''

``Have a carbo bar at least,'' said Daddy Mike, offering one,
which Mommy Lizet took, dipping it into the coffee.
``It's about a quarter after five.''

``Why are we up so early?  I thought we would eat breakfast
after Rudy and Rayne leave for school?''

Mommy Maria grinned.  ``Because Stephanie woke up really early.
And now Marco's awake too.
They're excited to begin the Seedling initiation,
so Mike and I decided to bring them early.
I probably need to record this explanation because
that's the third time you asked that question this morning.''

``Really?''

Stephanie giggled.  Mommy Lizet absently patted her hand.

``Why don't we wake Rudy and Rayne up?'' asked Marco.
``I know it's early and the schoolboat
won't pass here until seven thirty,
but at least we can say goodbye personally.''

``They were up late last night doing school projects,''
said Daddy Mike.  ``Let them sleep.
Waking them up is bad for their health.''

``It's just one day, dad,'' said Marco.

``That's what I told him, too,'' said Mommy Maria.

``Marco and Steph can just write notes for them.
And kiss them but don't wake them.''

``Nothing's as good as saying goodbye in person,''
said Stephanie.  ``Or at least by ekiga,'' she added,
winking at Daddy Red, who smiled back.

Daddy Mike grumbled.  ``Fine, then.
But finish your breakfast first,
my little sweets will want to eat when they get up
and we don't have enough seats here.''

``Anyway,'' said Daddy Red, ``the reason I wanted
to ekiga you before you left, is, well, Mike?''

``Uh, yes, Red.  Sweets, you have to wake up @emph{now},''
Daddy Mike told Mommy Lizet, poking her.

Mommy Lizet drank the rest of her coffee
in a single gulp.
She blinked, then breathed deeply.
``Children --- Stephanie, Marco --- today is your
Seedling initiation.  When you enter the Seedling boats,
you'll stop being de Alugbati, and become ex Alugbati.
And later when you form families of your own,
you'll pick a new family name for your own family.''

Her eyes drifted back into sleepiness.
Marco almost wanted to laugh at this,
but he guessed that this was a solemn leavetaking.

Stephanie grinned at it, though.

``So starting today,'' said Daddy Mike, ``you don't have to call
us `mom' or `dad' anymore.  Today, you'll start becoming adults.
A year from today, you'll officially be adults.
And then, you shall be equal in standing,
in the eyes of our laws and our culture, to us.''

``We hope you become upstanding, successful, and public-minded citizens,''
said Daddy Red, ``of whatever platform you choose to call your home.
We hope that you remember this:
for fifteen years, you were of the Alugbati family,
and we have always strived to instill the values
that we believe are necessary,
for the success of an individual,
for the success of a family,
and for the success of a sea platform.''

``And for the success of all of humanity,'' said Mommy Maria.
``Perhaps some day you too shall have children,
which you too shall send off as Seedlings
when they grow to this age.
And you too will know this:
that you love your children,
that you will want to protect them and to guide them,
and that the best thing to do is to let them go
and make their own path.''

``We love you,'' said Daddy Mike.
Their other parents nodded in agreement.

There was a moment of silence.

Marco forced himself to speak.  ``I love you too,''
he said.  Then, tentatively, ``Mike, and Red, and Fara
Lizet, and Maria --- I love you too.''

``I love you too, moms, dads,'' said Stephanie.
``I know we don't @emph{have} to call you that anymore
but you didn't say we have to @emph{not} call you that ---
so I'm going to call you that.  Is that okay?''

Their parents chuckled.
``I think it's okay with us, if you really want to,''
said Redemptor.

``Thanks,'' said Stephanie.  ``I really want to.
I'm really happy.  And nervous, and excited.
Thank you, moms, dads.''

@node The Walk of the Seedlings
@chapter The Walk of the Seedlings

Rudy and Rayne waved them off
as Marco and Stephanie crossed the threshold
between the private and public-use areas of the deck.

``Remember to e-mail us!'' said Rayne.

``We will!'' said Stephanie.

``Of course we will,'' said Marco.

``Take care!  Make sure to come back
and give us lots of money!
You know how tightwad Daddy Mike is!''
said Rudy.

``I heard that, Rudy,'' said Michael Alugbati.
Rudy stuck out his tongue at his father.

``So,'' said Marco, as they stepped off
their parents' homeboat
onto a pontoon connected to their neighbor,
``do we get a taxi?''

``No,'' said Michael, ``traditionally,
Seedlings are supposed to walk from their ex-homes
to the Seedling launch location.''

``But @emph{dad},'' said Stephanie,
``that can't be a tradition,
the Seedling initiations were started
just ten years ago,
this is just the fourth Seedling initiation,
there's not enough time for there
to be a tradition like that!''

``Sounds like just the right time
to start a tradition to me,''
said Michael.

``Wouldn't walking be fundamentally unfair?''
said Marco.
``I mean, some Seedlings would start farther
from the Seedling launch site than others.
Isn't the intent of the Seedling initiation
supposed to be to give an equal start to all
R1 and R2 teenagers?''

``It's not as if being tired
on this particular day
would have that big an effect
on your future.''

``But it @emph{could},'' said Stephanie.
``We'd be too tired to talk properly
to our roommates during Self-Introduction,
which could make us appear to be less valuable
as allies later on,
thus making us less actually valued by our peers
and greatly reducing our chance
of becoming successful.''

Michael just sighed loudly.

``Stop teasing your dad, sweethearts,''
said Fara Elizabeth Alugbati.
``Or your ex-dad, as your choice may be.
In any case, you won't have any access to money
until you get on the Seedling boats,
and we're not going to spring any to pay
for a taxi.''

``What if we memorized the private key
to the family wallet?'' asked Marco.

``Then accessing it after we kicked you
out of our homeboat would be stealing,
sweetheart,'' said Lizet.
``That is punishable by the laws
of pretty much every platform of Sea State.
The Alugbati family affiliates as a citizen of R1,
which most definitely has stealing as an illegal act,
and you would be punished
whatever the jurisdiction you decide to live under.
Starting this day you are viewed by the state of R1
and the various R2 platforms
as prospective adults.
You would then be treated as adults
if you access the property, without permission,
of an R1-affiliated citizen.''

``We lack sleep, Daddy Mike,'' said Stephanie.
``It's unhealthy to walk all the way to
Rationality One in this state,
hopping onto different pontoons and homeboats.
We might slip due to drowsiness and drown.
How could we be successful that way?''

Michael just sighed again.  Maria, Lizet, Stephanie,
and Marco just laughed and hugged him.

@sp 2

Their route required them to pass through
the public-use area of Lancer ex Caballeros' homeboat.
The two fully adult women almost had to drag
Michael off of the pontoon onto the deck
of the infamously eccentric old man's homeboat.

Marco stared at one of the reasons
for Michael's reluctance ---
a large sign on Lancer's private deck
with the following slogans:

@display
Strength from Diversity
Diversity from Tolerance
Tolerance from Understanding
Understanding from Rationality
@end display

A thickset, white-haired man
emerged onto the homeboat's private deck
and waved to them.
As usual, he was wearing his naval uniform,
emblazoned with advertisements from the sponsors
of his old navy.
Seeing him, Michael forced a pleasant smile
on his face and nodded in greeting.

``Good morning, neighbors!'' said Lancer.
``Hello, children.  Or I suppose you are Seedlings, now?''

``Sir, yes, sir, ex-admiral sir!'' said Stephanie,
smiling.

Lancer stood at attention and saluted.
``Succeed, Seedlings!
And remember that you're the future of R1 and all the R2's.
And if you can't decide on what to do with your life,
well, there's the navy!
Look up the Sea Strikers, or our siblings-in-arms,
the Ocean Hunters!''

Marco and Stephanie saluted in response,
then laughed and waved goodbye
to the eccentric retired navyman.

Michael, the last to step onto Lancer's homeboat,
was the first to hop onto the pontoon connecting it
to the next homeboat.

@sp 2

``It's illegal, that's what it is,'' said Michael.

``Just let it go, Mike,'' said Maria.
``He's just a harmless, eccentric old man,
all the kids like him,
they like hearing his stories of patrolling the high seas
and fighting sea pirates.''

``They haven't finished debating the merits and demerits
of that set of slogans,'' said Michael.
``He should keep it on R2 where the politics is done.
He could have just settled down on one of the R2 platforms
after retirement.
We'll vote for the slogans, or not vote for them,
after the R2's have finished their debates.
Let @emph{them} be the ones to subject their families
to the cutting edge of sociopolitical structures!
We chose R1 so that we could live in stability.
And all those advertisements!
On his clothes, on his deck, on top of his cabin,
he probably has them on his underwear.''

``You know how much he loves his old navy, sweetheart,''
said Lizet.
``He arranged for them to update him with
the current advertisements of their sponsors
and he puts them on his boat.
On the private part of his boat,
so that's not really any of our business.''

``The man's right to throw around garish photons ends
where my retina begins.''

``Now, Mike,'' said Maria,
``Remember, `Strength through Diversity.'
It takes all kinds of people to make a society.
And our own homeboat isn't pretty, either,
with all those weird things
Lizet and Red keep making
to get more electrical power
for the bitcoin mining rigs.''

``Bah, don't quote them to me!
I don't like hearing them.
It'll bias me when the R2 debates end
and R1 has to vote on whether to accept or reject them.''

Maria shrugged.  ``I don't know why Mike hates Lance so much,''
she whispered to Lizet.

``Oh, and you quoted it wrong,'' Michael added.
``It's `Strength @emph{from} Diversity,' not `through'.''

Behind his back, Lizet, Maria, Marco, and Stephanie
grinned at each other.

@sp 2

After a while, they realized that the route
they had chosen was broken.
Some homeboat had undocked from the pontoons,
and the gap was much too large to jump easily.
Michael and Lizet brought out their
personal computation pads to check the maps.

``It's still registered as being there,''
said Lizet.

``But it's not there, obviously, sweets ---''
Michael started to say.

``Just as obviously, sweetheart, it moved just today,
maybe not even an hour ago,
since the online map hasn't updated yet.
Maybe they have Seedlings to bring
to the Seedling initiation
and decided to bring their entire homeboat.''

Michael snorted.  ``Tragedy of the commons,''
he said.  ``If everyone did that,
there'd be too many homeboats clogging the area
around Rationality One each Seedling initiation.''

``I could just throw them across the gap,''
Maria offerred, flexing her muscles.

``Mom!'' the two Seedlings chorused.

``And toss all of you, too,'' said Maria.

``And who would toss you?'' said Michael.

``You could go on without me,'' said Maria.
``Go!  Run!  Before the Seedling boats leave the docks!
Run and chase your destiny, my Seedlings!''
she continued, in mock drama.

``We shall never forget your great sacrifice, dear mother!''
said Marco, laughing.

``Sweethearts, stop fooling around,'' said Lizet.
``Here's a new route with that boat made unpassable.
We'll just backtrack a little and go through that
pontoon bridge instead,'' she pointed.

``Or we could call that taxi over there,
my feet hurt already,'' said Stephanie.
``This knapsack's heavy.''

``Challenges make you stronger,'' said Michael.
``Let's go.''

``Wrong, dad, it goes
`what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.'
All this walking is killing me,
so walking can't make me stronger!''

Michael ignored her.

``Wait, I have a better idea,'' said Stephanie.
``Marco could carry me and my knapsack!''

``Definitely not, Steph,
you've been gaining weight recently,'' said Marco.

``I'm not, and you know it!'' said Stephanie.
``I know, I'll just call one of my boyfriends
and have him treat me to a taxi ride
to Rationality One.''

``Steph,'' Michael said, ``do you want to enjoy
these last few moments you'll have
with your parents before you go
on a one-year trip of self-discovery, or not?''

Stephanie's grin fell.  ``I want to be with you,''
she said.  ``I'm sorry.''

``Let's go and @emph{walk}, then.''

After a while,
Stephanie ran up to Michael and hugged him.
``Sorry, dad,'' she said.
``But I suddenly realized that these are also
the last moments when I'll get
to tease you personally!''

@sp 2

The Alugbatis encountered
more and more families with their Seedlings
as they approached the ship Rationality One.
Marco could soon make out a queue of Seedlings,
in their plain white, government-issued shirts,
on the deck of the converted warship.

A ramp led from a pontoon to that part of the ship.
An official stood at the lower end,
allowing only Seedlings to pass through.
A small crowd of well-wishing parents stood around her,
watching their Seedlings as they waited in line
for their ship assignments.

``Welcome to Rationality One,'' said Maria.
``This is where our walk ends.''

Marco and Stephanie started hugging their parents.

Lizet hugged Marco and kissed him.
Marco felt her press a small, flat and round
metallic object into his hand.
Then she whispered, ``this may be useful to you soon.''

When he looked at her in surprise, she whispered,
``Go west, sweetheart, and use this for the benefit
of all of humanity.''

He pocketed it, hoping nobody noticed.
He recognized it from its shape and composition.

His heart pounding, he approached the official
and gave her his papers,
hoping that he wasn't obviously sweating
and that his polite smile didn't look fake.
He rushed up the ramp when she let him pass.

It was something that gave him an unfair advantage.
It was something he never expected his parents
to give him, not as a Seedling.

It was a physical bitcoin.

@node The Seedling Counselor
@chapter The Seedling Counselor

``Marco de Alugbati,'' said the man behind the desk,
in a tiny government office onboard
the de facto government center Rationality One,
after Marco gave him the Seedling acceptance letter.
``Genetic child of Redemptor and Fara Elizabeth Alugbati,
registered child of Redemptor, Fara Elizabeth, Maria,
and Michael Alugbati.''

Behind the man was a poster of a pair of staring eyes.

``Yes, sir,'' said Marco.

``I'm Ricardo,'' the man said.
``Cognitivist Ricardo Derrick,
but just call me Ricardo.
I'm your Seedling counselor,
and I will conduct a short interview with you.
Then you will be evaluated and,
if deemed acceptable,
your name will be formally changed from
Marco de Alugbati to Marco ex Alugbati.
Are you ready?''

``Yes, Ricardo,'' said Marco.

``Good,'' said Ricardo, tapping on the keyboard
on his desk, not meeting his gaze.  ``Let's begin.''

Ricardo asked Marco a series of simple,
objective questions;
the cognitivist focused intently
on the computer screen.

``What's your age?''  ``Fifteen years and a month.''
``Have you completed basic education?'' ``Yes.''
``Have you completed intermediate education?'' ``Yes.''
``Have you completed basic rationality training?'' ``Yes.''
``How often do you socialize with friends?''  ``About once a week.''
...

And then the question that made Marco slip.

``Are you carrying anything other than the standard-issue
Seedling knapsack?''

Marco could almost say ``No.''  But, involuntarily,
his eyes met the staring eyes on the poster for a moment.
It made him pause.

Ricardo looked at him.  ``So, Marco,'' he said,
``you @emph{are} carrying something extra, aren't you?''

Marco nodded.
He felt the blood rush to his face,
and found himself
unable to meet Ricardo's eyes.

``A neat trick, isn't it?'' said Ricardo.
``Those eyes behind me, I mean.
Old cognitivist's trick.
While interviewing you we are not suppoed
to look directly at you,
as that would bias our judgment.
But seeing eyes stare at you forces you
to be honest.
And those unblinking, perenially staring eyes
up there force you to be very, very honest.''

Marco said nothing.

``That's strange,'' said Ricardo,
looking up something on his computer.
``You are listed as having surprisingly high
self-control, at least when you were five years old.
And you're de Alugbati.
Your parents are famous
for taking our laws and customs very seriously,
and for being extremely concerned about, and I quote,
`giving our rightful share for the advancement of society.'
I wouldn't have thought that you would bring
anything other than the items that were issued to you.
So what, exactly, are you bringing in?''

Marco fumbled for the coin in his pocket.
He showed it to Ricardo,
the placed it on the desk.

``What is it?'' Ricardo asked, frowning.

``It's a Casascius physical bitcoin,'' said Marco.
``It has a face value of twenty-five bitcoins,
as you see here under the big bitcoin symbol.
The `vires in numeris'
on the left side of the bitcoin symbol
means `strength in numbers,'
and is meaningful at several levels.
The number `2011'
on the right side is the year of minting.
Here on the flip side of the coin
is the tamper-resistant hologram label;
the eight printed characters in the center
are the first eight characters
identifying a bitcoin wallet
supposedly containing the face value amount.
Peeling off the hologram label will reveal
a small card containing the private key
that allows access to the bitcoin wallet,
and there is no conventional method
of returning the label afterwards.
This coin appears to be untampered,
although you should realize that less than a decade
after this coin was released,
enthusiasts had already found a way
to extract the card
without the tampering being evident.
Minting of this particular series of coin
was stopped almost immediately.
Currently, most of its value is actually
in its collectibility;
many collectors consider the face value
to be essentially zero,
and it is the coin itself,
being of limited minting,
that is valued.
I'd estimate it to be worth about
a hundred bitcoins
at an antiques shop today,
and a collector might be willing
to go as high as a hundred fifty bitcoins for it.''

Ricardo blinked.

``Mr. de Alugbati,'' Ricardo said,
``your family's business is bitcoin mining.
I must confess that as a cognitivist,
I only use bitcoins for receiving my salary
and paying for things.
Private keys, wallets ---
can you explain them to me?''

Marco nodded.  ``Well,
I suppose you have a bank account somewhere,
probably at R1 Bank?''

``Yes.''

``Now, a bank account is just
a name attached to a number,
the number being the amount of cash you own.
Your bank account is, of course,
protected by a personal identification number
or PIN, correct?''

``Correct.''

``So a bank account is just a name,
attached to a number, protected by a PIN.
Now, imagine the bitcoin system
as a giant, worldwide bank.''

``I don't see how the bitcoins system
would work like a bank.''

``Well, a bank is just a set of bank accounts, right?
And a bank account is just a record containing the name,
the current balance, and the PIN.
At the simplest and most naive level,
you could implement a bank as a set of index cards.
The bitcoin system is just a very special method
of storing that information on very many computers
over the Internet, with lots of encryption to ensure
that the none of the computers can be programmed
to cheat.''

``I see.''

``Think of each wallet as a `bank account,' associating a name ---
or rather, what we call the `public key' of the wallet ---
with a number, the number being the balance of bitcoins
in that wallet.
We use the public key instead of a name,
to allow anonymity ---
much like a numbered Swiss bank account.
The bank account is protected by the `private key,'
which is something like a PIN protecting the bank account.''

``Ah,'' said Ricardo, ``so this physical bitcoin is something
like a bank access card with the PIN written on it.''

``Yes, although the PIN is hidden by a tamper-resistant label.''

``How would I use it?''

``Well, one way of paying another person would be
to open an anonymous numbered bank account,
deposit the needed amount of money,
write the PIN on the bank access card,
then wrap the bank access card in a tamper-proof package
and give it to the other person.
The person would then be able to open the tamper-proof
package to withdraw the money.
Or alternately, he or she could pass it, still wrapped,
as payment to a third person,
who could further pass it to a fourth, and so on.''

``It doesn't seem to be very practical to me.''

``Well, creating a new bitcoin wallet is much easier
than opening an anonymous numbered bank account,
but you're correct, it is relatively impractical.
If both you and the other person have an account
in the same bank,
it's far easier to just transfer the amount
between your accounts.
And that's what a payment
in the bitcoin system actually is:
an inter-account transfer.
The impractical nature of these coins meant
that they were more of a publicity stunt
for the bitcoin system;
their impracticability is the reason for why
they had limited minting.
But today, the value of the coin is driven
by the historic nature of the coin
as an early publicity stunt
at a time when bitcoin was considered a passing fad,
and the limited minting of these coins.
It is valuable because it is impractical.''

Ricardo smiled.  ``Ironic, I suppose.
The value you just quoted me ---
a hundred bitcoins ---
is too large for me to overlook.
But knowing your family, a hundred bitcoins
wouldn't be much to them.
If I had been asked to imagine your parents
giving you something valuable,
something that would give you
an advantage over your peers,
I would have imagined them giving you
at least a thousand bitcoins,
and I'd probably seriously consider
ten times that.
They donated a thousand bitcoins
for this year's Seedling fund,
so anything they'd give to you
would have to match that.
And to risk this kind of scandal,
to only give you a hundred bitcoins...''
Ricardo shook his head.
``This was given to you by your parents?''

``Yes,'' said Marco.  ``Mommy Lizet ---
Fara Elizabeth Alugbati ---
gave it to me.
Just a little while ago.''

``Very strange.''
Ricardo rubbed his lips,
his forehead knotted.
``The value of this coin would be sufficient grounds
for me to cancel your Seedling acceptance letter
and have you discreetly sent back home.
But no matter how discreet it would be,
someone would know that you were caught trying to cheat.
Your parents would lose significant influence
once word of this leaks out,
and you would find your Seedling initiation delayed
until the next initiation.''

Ricardo leaned back in his chair.
``Did she tell you anything about it?''

``Well, all she told me was that
I might find it useful, and to go west
and help humanity.''

Ricardo raised his eyebrows,
but otherwise said nothing for a long while.

@sp 2

``Sir?'' asked Marco, ``does this mean that
I have to go...?''

``Can you try to remember exactly
what she told you?''  Ricardo said,
as if Marco hadn't asked a question.

``Uh... It went something like:
`You might find it useful soon.
Go west, sweetheart, and use this
to benefit all humanity.'
That's all I remember.''

Ricardo picked up the coin
and held it out to Marco.

``Take it.  I'm going out on a limb
and say that you never mentioned this,
and I trust that you will not
mention the coin to anyone,
until the time you need to use it.
Go on, take it.''

Puzzled, Marco took the coin.
At the brief touch,
he realized that Ricardo's hand was shaking.

``So she said `go west,' did she?'' asked Ricardo.
``Thank you for telling me.
There are --- some organizations, part of Sea State,
with particular code words and phrases.
Your parents are an important contact point
for one of those organizations.
As part of a --- common code ---
`go west' has a particular meaning.
It means: `prepare for imminent war.'
Your parents have just sounded a warning,
and used you, and most likely your sister,
to transmit that warning
to the central government of R1
and its associated sea platforms.''

``My parents are @emph{spies}?''

``Information processing nodes, actually.
Spymasters, not spies.''

Marco could not think of a proper reaction
to this revelation.

Ricardo smiled.
``Your parents are known to be very clever.
Especially Red and Lizet.
If you had managed to pass through this interview
without mentioning the coin,
then you would have accepted their advice
at the literal level.
Which means that you would, literally,
want to go west from R1.
So I suggest that you continue to follow the
literal meaning of the advice: go west.
Head west, and convince your fellow Seedlings
to head west.
Cross the South Pacific.
Head for the Dunbarite platforms, if you can.
And @emph{use} that coin.
I suspect its value is far, far more than a mere
one hundred bitcoins.''

@sp 2

``Here are the formal papers attesting to
your change of name and status
from child of the Alugbatis --- de Alugbati ---
to an adult that has left the Alugbatis ---
ex Alugbati.
This sealed envelope is your randomly-assigned
room number.
When you exit this room, turn right
and then open your room number envelope,
then board your assigned ship
and look for your assigned room on that ship.''

Marco took the offered papers, but remained seated.
``Ricardo, I'm sorry, but this has been so fast ---
I was expecting to be sent home,
shamed for trying to smuggle in a physical bitcoin.
Now you're telling me I can go?''

``Son, what you just told me means that we will be
a lot less strict about what the Seedlings are
allowed to bring on board.
The Alugbatis have sounded the alarm.
We may need to consider evacuating R1 and the R2's.
Right now, getting you and your fellow Seedlings out there
takes higher priority than
merely ensuring fairness.
Go, Seedling, and keep that coin safe!''

@sp 2

When Marco finally mustered enough self-awareness
to stand and leave, he turned right and walked a little,
then stopped.

He stood there for a moment, looking behind him.

Another Seedling exited from an adjacent office,
running past Marco.
Another Seedling then walked up from the waiting
area on a lower deck, and entered that office.
Then another Seedling exited another counselor's office,
jumping in joy, and soon another one entered timidly
into that office.

For a long while,
nobody entered Ricardo Derrick's office
after Marco left it.

@sp 2

As if in a dream, he opened the sealed envelope.

Seedling boat 3, room number 2.

He stood, staring at the paper.  He felt light and dizzy.
Everything around him felt somehow unreal and impossible.
He wondered whether to continue onward or turn back.

If war was imminent, wouldn't it be better
to be with his family?
With Rudy and Rayne and Daddy Mike and Mommy Lizet and
Mommy Maria and Daddy Red?

@emph{Your parents are known to be very clever.
Especially Daddy Red and Mommy Lizet,
but they're all clever.
If you had managed to pass through that interview
without mentioning the coin,
then you would have gone on
with the Seedling initiation.
Which probably means that
going on the Seedling initiation
is the best course of action
your parents could come up with.}

With a deep breath, he continued in the direction
that Ricardo had indicated.

@node The Gardeners
@chapter The Gardeners

Sara ex Mulligan waited, in her old tub of a homeboat,
beside the newly 3D-printed hull of this year's
Seedling boat 3.
Her fellow Gardener, Renee Magnus,
should be arriving soon.

The cognitivists of Rationality One
were supposed to be the ones
who would brief Renee Magnus.

Except that a few minutes ago,
a cognitivist had contacted her via ekiga
and informed her that a situation had come up
that would require their attention.
They were too busy
to brief the new Gardener
on her duties.
She would have to be the one
to introduce Gardening
to her new partner.

The irregularity --- @emph{worried} her.

In previous years,
the cognitivists had insisted on
briefing her,
even though she had been part
of the Seedling project
even before it had been introduced
to R1 ten years ago.
She had been one of the first Gardeners
who had volunteered for a limited trial run
of the concept
on one of the R2 platforms,
before it could be accepted for voting
by the main, R1 platform.

A sleek, fast homeboat cruised beside hers,
stopping to align their public-use decks.

Sara ex Mulligan opened the door of her cabin
to greet Renee.

@sp 2

``Good morning,'' said Sara,
standing at the demarcating line between
the public-use and private parts
of Renee Magnus's homeboat,
once she had tied their decks together.

``Greetings,'' said the middle-aged woman
who emerged from the other cabin.
``I am Renee Magnus.
My husband Simon is inside.
Sara ex Mulligan, I presume?"'

``Yes,'' said Sara.
``Welcome to the Seedling initiation of
the R1 platform and all the R2 platforms.
You have volunteered to be a Gardener ---
a counselor, guide, and guardian
for our Seedlings.
You have thus been assigned to be
one of the two Gardeners
of Seedling boat 3, here.
Normally, this briefing would be conducted
by a cognitivist of Rationality One,
but, due to unavoidable circumstances,
I will be the one giving you this briefing.
Have you read the handbook?''

``I have,'' said Renee.  ``Please, do come in.''

Sara suppressed a slight fidget.
``Actually, I've prepared the presentation
on my homeboat's computer.
So I'd like to invite you to my own homeboat.
Your family may also attend,
although it may be a tight fit
if there are more than two people
in my cabin.''

``Ah --- thank you for your invitation.
I suppose my husband can wait for me.''

@sp 2

``Do you have any questions?'' asked Sara
at the conclusion of her briefing.

``Well,'' said Renee, ``no socialization
with your fellow Gardeners ---
that seems strange to me.''

``The cognitivists insisted on that,'' said Sara.
``The original Seedling initiation plan
did not have that rule,
but apparently the cognitivists worried
that the partner Gardeners might collude
in order to cheat the Seedlings
or otherwise abuse their position.
The reason for having two Gardeners per Seedling boat
is for them to keep an eye on one another,
as well as to keep an eye on the Seedlings themselves.
Apparently, a classic cognitivist piece of advice
is that dishonesty is limited
if there is a stranger monitoring you,
but the dishonesty rises and erases that effect
once you get become familiar and friendly
with the monitor.
In essence, if the monitor is no longer a stranger,
you might prefer to cooperate with him or her specifically,
rather than cooperate with the entirety of society.
Hence the no socialization rule.''

``But to have you brief me on the rules
of Gardening ---''

``Is not normal procedure, actually.''
Sara wondered if continuing
on this conversation topic
was a good idea.
She did not know
the reason for this irregularity,
and she suspected that sharing her speculations
could be considered too near to socialization.

On the other hand,
this briefing, by itself,
could be considered a form of socialization ---

``So what @emph{is} normal procedure?''
Renee asked.

``Normally, a fresh Gardener would be briefed
by certified cognitivists of Rationality One.
And they'd also insist that long-time Gardeners,
like me,
should also be briefed each time.''

``How long have you been a Gardener?''

Sara smiled thinly.
``I'd prefer to answer questions about
the rules of Gardening,
rather than personal questions about myself.''

``My apologies,'' said Renee.
``I suppose that falls under socialization.''

``Yes.''

``As to the rules of Gardening ---
the rules have been bent, have they not?''
said Renee.
``I accept the reasoning for
why we should not socialize ---
but this briefing would make us,
at least a little,
somewhat more familiar with each other.
Which suggests to me
that your cognitivists
are currently very concerned
about something
they consider much more important
than the future of your precious Seedlings.
What could it be?''

Sara just shook her head.
She'd already thought as much,
on receiving the order
to handle this briefing by herself.

``Now, now,'' Renee pressed forward,
``The rule on not socializing with
your fellow Gardener has been bent.
I suggest that sharing information we have
has more valuable utility
than attempting to maintain a rule
whose spirit has already been violated.''

``You are from a Dunbarite platform,''
said Sara, still shaking her head.

``My Dunbarite platform has its own name, you know.
And what if I am?'' Renee said,
suppressed anger at the edge of her voice.
``I am still a citizen of Sea State.
R1 may be the largest and most well-known
platform of Sea State,
it may serve as the de facto capital city
of Sea State,
it may have a navy of client platforms
it simply calls `the R2's,'
without even the dignity of
individual names for each platform ---
but this does not justify
your apparent mistrust, withholding
possibly vital information.''

Sarah remained silent,
still uncertain,
tense.

Renee sniffed.
``Very well, then,'' she said.
``I shall endeavour to gain your trust,
unjustified though I consider your mistrust may be.
I am part of a network of knowledge workers
who monitor world events.
A short while ago, a node of our network,
here on R1, went silent ---
suspiciously silent.
By backtracking through the information shared
and queries sent
by that node,
I concluded that this node had became worried
about the possibility
that Sea State might get into conflict ---
with what, I do not know.
That is, in fact,
the true reason for why I volunteered
for the cultural exchange program
between our platform and R1,
and why I volunteered to be
a Gardener for this year's Seedling initiation.''

``I see,'' said Sara, finally.
She held up her hand, and said,
``Let me think for a moment.''

After a while, she said,
``Obviously, the reason for
their disregard for the Seedling's future
is their concern
for the Seedling's @emph{present}.''

``Obviously,'' said Renee.
She stared hard at Sara,
challenging her to give more information.

``I'm not sure if it's relevant,'' Sara said,
``but the no-socialization rule
had been an important point
that the cognitivists of R1 have always insisted on.
To be honest, I thought it was quite impractical
to impose that rule
when they first proposed it ---
or rather, when they first insisted on it.
The cognitivists also recommended
shuffling the Gardeners
when the Seedlings get shuffled between boats,
to help enforce the needed separation.
To allow that rule to be bent now ---
means that the conflict you told me about
must be something to be taken seriously.''

``You've been with the Seedling program
since the beginning?''

``I've been a Gardener since the Seedling program
was prototyped on an R2 platform,'' Sara said,
unconsciously sitting a little straighter.
``Since before the beginning,
in essence
a very small part
of its conception.
Now tell me, miss member-of-a-network ---
is war coming?
If war comes,
where can my beloved Seedlings grow?''

@node Seedling Boat 3; Room Number 2
@chapter Seedling Boat 3; Room Number 2

Marco climbed down the ladder
from Rationality One
leading to a boat
emblazoned with the sign
`Seedling Number 3.'
He presented his papers
to the official
standing at the demarcating line
between the public-use
and private parts of the boat's deck.

The official handed the papers back,
then said, with a practiced, cheery smile
and a slight bow,
``Welcome, Mr. @emph{ex} Algubati,
to Seedling boat 3!''

He was on the vessel he would call
his homeboat for at least three months.

His heart still pounding, not yet recovered
from the interview with the Seedling counselor,
he took the papers,
entered the private part of the deck,
and climbed a short staircase leading
to the rooms inside.

@sp 2

The room had four bunk beds, two on each of
the longer sides,
and two smaller doors
at the end opposite the entrance,
which Marco supposed led to toilets.
On the left-side upper bunk
lay a young man,
who appeared to be napping.

``Hello,'' Marco said softly.

``Oh, hello!'' said the young man,
who got up.
``Cheers de Littlefoot.
Err, I mean Cheers ex Littlefoot.''
He extended his hand.
``Pleased to meet you, roommate!
You are?''

``Marco ex Alugbati,'' said Marco,
closing the door
and reaching up
to shake Cheers' hand.

``Good, good,'' said Cheers.
``I'll confess I was hoping to be
the only guy in a room of girls,
but I guess I'll have to settle
for a much more normal two guys,
two girls setup.''

Marco forced himself to smile
at this crudity.
``I think most of us have fantasized
something like that.''

Cheers laughed.  ``No, no, my friend!''
His name certainly seemed aproppriate.
``You misunderstand.
We're all guys in my family.
So I was hoping to find out
what it is like
to live with girls.
Are they as noisy and strange as
my research has led me to believe?''

``I doubt real girls are as noisy
and strange as you are,''
said Marco.
``So your siblings are all boys?''

``Yes, but it's even worse than that,
roommate!''  said Cheers.
``My parents are both boys.
They're a homosexual couple.
I'm straight, to their lasting disappointment.
Straighter than a straight edge,
as my fathers like to say.
My younger brother is better in that regard.
He's the only sibling I have.
Anyway, welcome to Seedling boat 3's
room number 2.
Pick a bunk!
You can have any of those three.''

Marco threw his knapsack
into the remaining upper bunk
and climbed into it.
``So... are you adopted?'' he asked.
He suspected the question
would not be even remotely offensive
to his cheery roommate.

``Ah, no!'' said Cheers.
``I'm a biological child of both my fathers.
And my mystery deepens,
does it not, my friend?
It's hard to explain,
but I promise I'll tell all
at my Self-Introduction later,
when our room is complete.
Anyway, I got up very early today,
which is why I got this nice bunk,
which is fractionally nicer than yours,
and orders of magnitude better
than the bottom bunks.
You are to be complimented
on your choice of bunk.
In any case, as I mentioned,
I woke up early and
I'm a little sleepy right now.
I'll nap just a bit, okay?''

``Okay,'' said Marco.

Not knowing what to do,
and still not quite calm enough to sleep,
he opened his knapsack
and took out the computation pad.
He enabled it and waited for it
to connect to the ship's wireless.

@sp 2

The computation pad was a cheap, low-power model.
It had an electronic paper main display,
which took a visible fraction of a second
to refresh at each change,
and a smaller low-resolution black-and-white LCD display,
which was used to show the text he was currently entering.
It was far less powerful
than the computation pad
his parents had given him,
when he was still de Alugbati.
Still, it was all that he was allowed to use,
as a Seedling.

He wrote a short note to his family.

@quotation
Hello!

I'm on board!

I'm on Seedling boat 3, room number 2.
There's one other guy here now,
Cheers ex Littlefoot.
He's a little weird, I think.
He says he's girl-obsessed
because both of his parents are guys
and all he has
is a younger brother for a sibling.

He says he's the biological son
of both his fathers.
Don't know how that happened.
He says he'll explain everything later,
in Self-Introduction.

We're waiting for our two remaining roommates.
I guess they'll probably both be girls,
to balance things out.

Rudy, sorry, but I haven't earned lots of money yet.
You'll have to beg your Daddy Mike
to raise your allowance for now.

My love to you all.
I miss you already, Mike, Lizet, Red, Maria,
Rudy and Rayne.
I wonder if I'll get to be on the same boat
as Steph after the shufflings.
@end quotation

Then he sent the message by e-mail.

He debated with himself for a short while.
Then he created another e-mail,
addressed only to Fara Elizabeth Alugbati,
agonizing over almost each word,
crafting the message to be
as innocous as possible,
and yet having some meaning,
if you knew
particular bits of information beforehand.

@quotation
Hi mom!

I just had to tell my Seedling counselor,
Cognitivist Ricardo Derrick,
about your advice to go west.

He seemed to understand.

He agreed that I should use
the resources that all our parents
pooled together and gave to us Seedlings
to go west.

Love, Marco.
@end quotation

@sp 2

He waited for a reply from his family
for a moment,
but none came.

Then he wondered about the physical bitcoin
that his mother had given him.
The 8-digit code printed on the coin itself
was not long enough to identify the bitcoin wallet
containing the face value amount,
but he knew that files could be found
on the internet
which mapped Casascius physical bitcoin codes
to the full wallet address.

He found a few copies of that file,
which all matched up the same,
and then found a PGP signature
known to be made by Casascius himself
attesting to the veracity of those copies.
Keeping an eye on Cheers,
who seemed to be genuinely asleep,
he took out the coin
and copied the 8-digit code
into the computation pad,
then put the coin back
into his pocket.

He looked up the 8-digit code
in the file,
then copied the complete wallet address
and looked it up
on Block Explorer, @url{blockhain.info}.

To his surprise,
the wallet address contained
the full face value of twenty-five bitcoins.

But in order to withdraw it,
he would have to open the coin
and extract the private key
that would allow acccess
to the wallet.
Obvious tampering would drastically lower
the collector's value of the coin itself ---
which was much higher than the face value
of the coin ---
and he doubted he had enough skill
to peel and return the hologram label
without damage.

Then he heard a knock on the door,
disabled his computation pad,
and saw Cheers get up from his bunk.
He himself got up as the door opened.

@sp 2

``Hello,'' said the young man at the door.

``Hello!'' said Cheers.
``Cheers ex Littlefoot.
Pleased to meet you,
roommate!'' he said,
extending his hand.
``You are?''

``I'm Damian Carlo ex Mantis,''
said the young man.
``Call me Damian.''
He shook Cheers' hand.

``Hi Damian,'' said Marco,
extend his hand.
``I'm Marco ex Alugbati.
Pleased to meet you.''

``My pleasure,'' said Damian,
shaking his hand.

``Welcome to Seedling boat 3's
room number 2!'' said Cheers.
``You can have any
of the two bunks below us.''

Damian nodded and put his knapsack
in the bunk under Marco's.

``I have to confess,
I was hoping my last two roommates
would be girls,'' said Cheers.
``In order to properly balance
the room.
Ah well, I guess our last roommate
is our only hope
of a feminine touch.''

``Well,'' said Damian,
as he sat on his chosen bunk
and took out his computation pad,
``Given already two males in the room,
there's only slightly more than 25% chance
of getting two females in the remaining
two slots.''

Then Damian took out a small keyboard
and connected it to his computation pad.

``Hey, how'd you get that?'' asked Cheers.
He frowned, disapproving of the device.

``This keyboard?'' said Damian.
``Smuggled it in.
Not like it's gonna be a big advantage
over the rest of you, eh?
Besides, if anyone asks,
I used the standard-issued R3PP
to make it anyway.
If I hadn't,
it's the first thing I'd have to do
after we choose destinations anyway.''

``I guess,'' said Cheers, still frowning.

``Sorry, but I'm a programmer,
and I hate touchscreeens,'' Damian said.
``Something wrong with my skin's galvanic response,
or something,
so that touchscreens sometimes fail
to register my tapping.
Touchscreens don't have tactile feedback,
and the worst combination
is this slow electrophoretic electronic paper display,
which means that the visual feedback is slow.
It's like trying to program with both hands tied
behind your back.
Still nothing faster than a touch typist
using a tactile, button-based, physical keyboard.''

``What did you say when the Seedling counselor
asked you if you were carrying items
that weren't in the standard-issue knapsacks?''
asked Cheers.

``Hmm?'' Damian said.  ``Don't remember being asked
about extra items.
Sounds dumb to ask that,
could just lie, right?
Prolly just weeding out idiots
who can't lie.''

``I guess,'' said Cheers.
He still frowned at
Damian's keyboard,
then shook his head.

Marco wished he could tell them
about the eyes on the poster,
and the physical bitcoin.

@sp 2

Cheers settled back down to nap,
and Damian leaned out of sight,
probably to program his computation pad.

Marco lay back again and checked his mail.

There was a message from Steph.

@quotation
Hey bro!

We're lucky!
I'm on Seedling boat 3 too!
Room 5.
Looks like I'll be seeing you!

There's a cute girl here,
maybe I'll introduce you to her,
what do you think?
She's Susan ex Guillermo,
she's also from R1.

Your roommate Cheers sounds interesting!
I'm curious about how he got to be
the biological son
of both of his fathers.
That makes him sound like the unnatural product
of a laboratory experiment!

Anyway, Rayne, Rudy, study well
and maybe I'll send you something nice,
haha.
I love you two!
Hope you're comforting Daddy Mike,
he's probably crying about losing
two of his children
on the same day!
Hugs and kisses everyone!

After he finished reading Steph's e-mail,
he saw another message in his inbox.

It was from Red,
carbon-copied to all of his parents.

@quotation
Hello Marco,

It's good to know
that the cognitivists of Rationality One
agree with us.

Love, Red.
@end quotation

@sp 2

Just as Marco had read Red's message,
he heard a knock on the door.
They all got up to greet their last
roommate.

Slowly, the door opened,
revealing a short young man.

Cheers grinned.  ``Hello!
Cheers ex Littlefoot.
Pleased to meet you, roommate!
You are?''
He extend his hand.

The young man bowed slightly,
his cheeks flushed,
and stuttered slightly.
``I'm J--- I'm John de ---
John ex Nikos.''
He bowed again.
``I'm pleased to meet you too,
and I hope we can work together
as roommates.''

``Hello,'' said Damian.
``Damian Carlo ex Mantis.''
They shook hands.

``Hello!'' said Marco.
``I'm Marco ex Alugbati.''
He extended his hand to John.

John beamed a lopsided, shy smile at him,
took his hand and shook it.
Then he bowed a little
and backed into the remaining empty bunk.

``Sadly, it seems that
we'll all be boys in this room.''
said Cheers.
``How unlikely could that get?''

``Not so unlikely,'' said Damian.
``One out of sixteen approximately.
Given 7 rooms a boat,
and seven boats,
expect maybe two or three
all-male rooms,
and maybe about the same number of
all-female rooms.''

``Maybe we'll get to be with girls
after the Shuffling
three months from now, eh?''
Cheers said.
He winked at Marco,
then shook his head ---
possibly in mock sadness, Marco thought.

``Sorry,'' John said.
Marco heard Damian grunt.

``No need to be, roommate!'' said Cheers
``So!  It looks like we're all here.
Come on!''
He rubbed his hands, beaming at them.
``Let's start Self-Introduction!''

@node The Politician
@chapter The Politician

``Does anyone feel a pressing need
to volunteer to go first?'' asked Cheers.

``No,'' said Damian.
Marco shrugged and John shook his head.

``Ah well!'' said Cheers.
``Somebody has to go first,
so to break the ice,
I'll volunteer.''
He got off his bunk
and bowed.
Marco clapped a little.

``Hi, roommates!'' said Cheers, waving his hand.
``I'm Cheers ex Littlefoot,
as I told you all before.
I'm from an R2 platform.
My parents manage part of
the sea fertilization pumps
south of R1,
and also operate a fleet of fishing boats
as a side business.
But to be honest,
they don't really think of themselves
as enterpreneurs, or fishermen, or managers.
As they keep on telling me and my brother ---
they're politicians.
The work they do is
just to pay the bills.
But their @emph{passion},
their @emph{drive} ---
that's for politics ---
or in their own words,
designing the policies
to make human society
more efficient.''

``Wow,'' said John.

``Please, I am just the children of my fathers,''
said Cheers.
``I have yet to live up to their ambitions and dreams.''

``Fathers?'' asked Damian.

``As I told our good roommate Marco ---
my two parents are both male.
Papa Samuel and Papa Havelock Littlefoot.''

``Really?'' said John.

``Really!'' said Cheers.
``They keep saying over and over again that
they're gayer than a gay old time,
whatever that means ---
some old joke, I guess.
Oh, by the way ---
I am also the biological son
of both of my fathers!''
He grinned, teasing them,
then bowed again.

``You said that to me earlier,'' said Marco.
``How'd that happen?''

``Quite simply, actually,'' said Cheers.
``My fathers made a deal with 
lesbian couple
who also wanted to have children.
They would donate semen
for artificial insemination,
and my biological mothers
would get one child
and my fathers would get the other.
My fathers decided to combine their semen,
and with genetic profiling,
I turned out to be a genetic chimera,
with genes from both of my fathers.
So I am, in fact,
quite literally the son of my fathers.''

``What's a genetic chimera?'' said John.

``Multi-celled organism with
cells from different genetic lines,''
said Damian.
``Basically means that Cheers
should have been fraternal twins,
except the two fertilized egg cells
joined together to form one fetus
rather than two separate fetuses.''

``Thank you very much, Damian!'' said Cheers.
``A clear and concise explanation.
My gonads, after genetic testing,
turned out to be genetically from
Papa Havelock,
so I'm registered as the genetic child
of Havelock Littlefoot
and Michelle Wisteria.''

``Have you met your genetic mother?''
asked Marco.

``Oh, we visit each other occassionally,''
said Cheers.
``My genetic mother and her partner
is from the Dunbarite platform
`Sharp Insight.'
My half-sister Janelle de Wisteria
is just a few days older than me.
Age of adulthood on `Sharp Insight'
is 17 years old, though,
so I'm an adult before she is,
ha ha!''

``Why did your parents choose `Littlefoot'?''
asked John.

``I don't know,'' said Cheers.
``They never really told us about why
they chose that name.
Anyway, they were both
already highly active politicians
when they met each other
and started their relationship.
They said they enjoyed
debating with each other
on politics ---
`sparring sessions' is
what they would call it,
ha ha!''
John and Cheers chuckled.

Damian blinked.
``What's funny about `sparring session'?''

John cleared his throat.
``Well, while `sparring' is used to refer
to a one-on-one friendly competition
in a combat sport
for the purpose of training,
the base word `spar' itself
literally means a, um,
thick, strong wooden pole.
So, in the context of, um,
a homosexual male couple ---''

Damian groaned.
``Okay, okay, understood.''

``Thank you, John!'' said Cheers.
``Don't worry, my good roommate Damian,
it took me a @emph{very} long time
to understand
a lot of my fathers' jokes.
Papa Samuel likes to say it needs
a strong and sharp intellect
to really get into
and enjoy Papa Havelock's basest.''
He smiled even wider
than Marco had ever seen him smile so far.

Damian groaned again.

@sp 2

``Apologies, my friend!'' said Cheers,
bowing to Damian, as if he were a stage actor.
``I am the child of two men
who had a deeply nuanced enjoyment
for two things:
off-color homosexual innuendo and politics.
Despite being straighter than a straight edge,
I find that, like my beloved parents,
my passions are for the same.''

Marco started clapping,
which John and even Damian joined.

``So, Cheers,'' said Marco,
``I guess those would be
your hobbies?''

``Yes, Marco,'' said Cheers.
``The study of power,
the exercise of power,
the transfer and exchange of power,
and the words we use to justify
the actions that surround
the manipulation of power.
That, and how words can be arranged
into having both prosaic
and perverted meanings.''

John clapped, strong and vigorous.

``Thank you!'' said Cheers.
``I'm afraid that's all I can think of
to tell about myself.
Is there anything any of you
are curious about?''

``You said earlier that
you had a younger brother,''
said Marco.
``And you mentioned a sister, too.''

``My younger brother, Petrie de Littlefoot,
was born from another
arranged artificial insemination
with a different lesbian couple,
a few years after me;
he's 11, I'm 16.
He might be gay, like my parents,
which delights them, of course.
My sister Janelle de Wisteria is basically a sister
simply because her biological mother
is the family partner
of my own biological mother;
genetically, we have different parents,
as she got her genes from Daddy Samuel.
Neither of them are chimeras,
as it happens,
so they only have
two biological parents each.
Which makes them quite boring
compared to me,
right?''

``Your younger brother is named @emph{Petrie}?''
said John.
``That's quite interesting.''

``Why is that?'' said Cheers.

``Um, well...'' said John.
He appeared suddenly uncomfortable

``There is no need to explain, of course,''
said Cheers, smiling at John,
``although it does pique my curiousity,
roommate!
As you can see,
my parents seem to like
unusual names.''

John bowed slightly, then cleared his throat
and sat straighter.
``As far as I can remember,
the name `Littlefoot' is from a
classic animated video,
`The Land Before Time,'
released in the late twentieth century.''
said John.
``It's set at or near
the end of the age of the dinosaurs.
All the characters are dinosaurs
who can speak and think.
The story revolves around Littlefoot,
a baby apatosaurus,
whose mother dies,
leaving him orphaned.
He then goes on a quest
to search for the `Great Valley,'
which his mother always told him about,
and along the way
gathers a small group
of fellow orphaned dinosaurs
of various species.
Two other characters
are a female triceratops
named `Cera,' which I think
is suspiciously similar to `Cheers,'
and somewhat skittish male Pteranadon
named `Petrie.'
Littlefoot himself makes friends easily
and is the leader of his group of friends,
which I suspect
are traits that your parents value,
and is probably the reason why
they selected that name for their family.''

Cheers stood with his mouth open,
staring at John.

@sp 2

Once Cheers recovered, he laughed,
bowing to John.

``Thank you, my good friend!'' he said,
still chuckling.
``The Seedling initiation
is supposed to be
a year-long voyage
of self-discovery
for us.
And on my very first day,
you have helped me discover
important knowledge
about my own family.
I am in your debt,
John!''

John bowed, blushing.
``Th-thanks,'' he said.

``The pleasure is mine,'' said Cheers.
``Would any of you like to know more about me?
Or more importantly ---
perhaps some of you already know more
about me and my family
than I do myself, like John did?
Marco?  Damian?''

Damian shrugged.

``I can't think of anything more to ask,''
said Marco.

``Then I suppose my Self-Introduction
is done!'' said Cheers.
``Is there anyone who would like to volunteer
to be next?''

Damian, Marco, and John
just looked at each other
and shook their heads.

``Well, then!'' said Cheers.
``I propose that we do Self-Introduction
in the order that we arrived.
I was first,
then Marco,
then Damian,
then John.
Marco, if you please?''

@node The Banker
@chapter The Banker

Marco shrugged in resignation,
and descended from his bunk,
taking Cheers' place
in the middle of the room.

``Hello, everyone,'' said Marco.
``My name is Marco ex Alugbati.
I'm from R1.
My parents are primarily bitcoin miners,
and also have side investments.
I have an older sister,
Stephanie ex Alugbati,
who is also a Seedling now,
and, as I found out just a little while ago,
is actually on this same boat.
She's in room number 5.
Oh ---
I have four parents.
Although I guess that's far less interesting
than Cheers having two genetic fathers.''

``Don't worry about it, my friend!'' said Cheers,
``Each one of us here, I suppose, has his or her own
unique, fully interesting story.''

``His or @emph{her}?'' said Damian.

``If we were to refer to all Seedlings here today,
so to speak,'' said Cheers.
``So, Marco, as you were saying
about your four parents?''

@emph{They're spymasters, not spies, actually,}
some naughty part of Marco whispered
deep in the recesses of his brain.
@emph{Oh, and they gave me this
physical bitcoin,
which as a collector's item
is priced at maybe one hundred bitcoins.
Which is probably enough to buy
a used homeboat for myself,
plus some spare change
to start a small business.
And a cognitivist ---
a cognitivist! ---
thinks that it is somehow
far, far more valuable
than its fair market value
as a collector's item.}

What he actually said was,
``Yes, I have four parents.
Daddy Mike, Daddy Red, Mommy Lizet, and
Mommy Maria.
They originally were two separate couples,
but Daddy Red and Mommy Lizet
got into each other romantically
and intellectually.
They still loved
their spouses very much, though,
and still wanted to be with them.
So they convinced their spouses
to form a single larger family.
And it was from there
that the Alugbati family was formed.''

@emph{Is it true, though?} he wondered.
@emph{Or did they decide that their
`information processing node'
would be more efficient that way?}

``Wow,'' said John.
Damian gave him a bemused smile.

``You know, sometimes my friends
ask me what it's like
growing up with two male parents
and no female ones,'' said Cheers.
``But now you've got me wondering
what it's like
to grow up with two male parents
@emph{and} two female parents.''

``You know how you can ask your mom ---
or one of your dads, in Cheers' case, I guess ---
for something
and she denies it to you,
then you could try to ask, um, your other parent
and maybe the other one will give in to you?''
Marco said, pausing for greater impact.
``Well, I've got it even better,
because if I fail to convince two,
I still have two more chances
of getting what I want!''

They chuckled.

``You know,'' said Marco,
``a four-parent family is
actually more stable,
according to Daddy Red.
We call him `Rad Dad,' sometimes,
when our parents can't hear us,
because he can come up
with really great ideas.
We call Daddy Mike `Mad Dad,' too,
because he's usually the one who scolds us
about not fixing the beds,
things like that.''

Cheers asked, ``Why does your Rad Dad
say a four-parent family is more stable?''

``Childcare duties are more distributed,''
said Marco.
``And if you get in a fight with one partner
you can get comfort from two other partners,
and they can act as mediators between you.
You have more resources in total to pool togehter,
and you can cook larger meals more efficiently.
Four parents are not so large to coordinate,
so that's sort of like a sweet spot ---
more people to get more done,
but not so many that coordination
becomes a problem.
And so on.
Things like that.
To be honest,
I've lived with four parents for so long
that it's the idea of having just two parents
in a family
that seems @emph{weird} to me.
Although I suppose your point of view
would be drastically different.''

John nodded in sympathy.
Damian still looked bemused.

``And you know,'' said Marco,
``it's not likely the cognitivists
would allow polyamorous marriage
to be legalized
if their studies showed
it would have
any significant negative effect
on society.
As long as it was simply an option,
not something you'd be obligated to do,
anyway.''

``Still atypical,'' said Damian.

``Most people would have at least one trait
that's atypical,'' said Marco.

``I agree!'' said Cheers.
``Now, Marco, tell me something ---
just how does bitcoin mining work?''

Marco grinned.
``It might take some time to explain,''
he said.
``Are you sure you want me
to explain all that?''

@sp 2

``Why not?'' said Cheers,
looking at the others.
``It's Self-Introduction.''

Marco shrugged.
``Okay,'' he said,
``but no complaining about
how complicated it is, deal?''

The others nodded agreement.

``Good,'' he said.
``Now, first things first.
You know how banks
handle your bank accounts?''

Cheers shrugged, and John shook his head.
Damian said,
``Yeah, something congruent
to a mapping from a name to a bank balance
and security information.''

``Yes, something like that.
Basically, a bank account
is just a name attached to a number,
plus, as Damian said, security information.
The number is your bank balance.
The security information is something
like your birthday
or a parent's birth name.
Okay so far?''

The other nodded.

``Now the important part of the bank
is storing the account information:
basically, the big, master list
of the account name, account balance,
and security information.
And the bitcoin system is,
at its core,
just that.
In the bitcoin system,
the `bank account` is the bitcoin wallet,
and the `account name' is the wallet address.
The `security information' is the private key
to the wallet,
and the `account balance' is
the money in the wallet.
The entire bitcoin system
is simply the information about
the set of wallets ---
basically, the data of
the bitcoin bank accounts ---
stored across all the computers
of bitcoin miners all over the world.''

``Distributed hash table,'' said Damian.
To Marco, it sounded like
just so much gibberish.

``Wait, what ensures that
the bitcoin miners don't
transfer all the money
to their own, um `bank accounts'?''
said John.

``The security information
of the bitcoin wallet,''
said Marco.
``The security information
in the bitcoin system
is composed of two keys.
This is the public key:
it's the part of your security information
that is stored in the bitcoin system,
which, since it is duplicated
on each bitcoin miner's computer,
is effectively public information.
Then there's the private key,
which is not stored in the bitcoin system ---
it's private.
There's a special mathematical relationship
between the number representing the public key
and the number representing the private key.
This allows something to be encrypted
using the public key,
which can then only be decrypted
using the private key.
It also allows the inverse:
it allows something to be encrypted
using the private key,
which can then only be decrypted
using the public key.
Okay so far?''

``Okay,'' said Cheers,
``something encrypted with the public key
can only be decrypted with the private key,
and vice versa.''

``Good.
So if any bitcoin user
wants to transfer some money
from their account
to somebody else's,
they encrypt the request to transfer
using the private key.
The encrypted request
can be decrypted
using the public key.
So suppose I'm a bitcoin miner.
In order to verify that you are
the owner of the account,
you have to encrypt the transfer request
using the private key,
and since I know the public key,
I can verify that
by simply decrypting the transfer request
using the public key.
And no one,
not even the bitcoin miners,
can falsify a transfer request,
because even the bitcoin miners
would not be able
to encrypt using the private key,
because all we have
is the public key.''

``You said there's a mathematical relationship
between the public and private keys,''
said John.
``Wouldn't it be possible to derive one
from the other, then?''

``Yes --- in theory,
but not in practice.
You see,
there are certain mathematical operations
that are reversible,
but which are much easier to do one way
than the other way.
For example:
what are the two prime factors
of the number 91?''

Damian grinned.
The others just shrugged their heads.
``I don't think I still remember
how to do prime factors,''
said Cheers.

``Right.
But if I asked you to multiply
the numbers 7 and 13,
would you be able to do it?''

``With pen and paper, yes,''
said Cheers.
``Or a computation pad, ha.''

``Precisely.
Now, the prime factors of the number,
when multiplied together,
result in that number.
It's easier to do the multiplication
from the two prime numbers
than to get the prime factorization
from the product.
Similarly, the private key is
very hard to derive
from the public key:
it's the prime factors
of the public key.
But the public key is simply the product
of two components of the private key.
It's theoretically possible
to get the private key from the public key,
but it would require more computing hardware
than is available in the whole world.
See?''

John nodded.

Then Cheers said,
``That lets the bitcoin miner
verify that the bitcoin user
is allowed to transfer the amount.
How does the bitcoin user
make sure that the bitcoin miner
updates the account balances correctly?''

Marco smiled.
``A good point.
Now, the informal slogan
of the bitcoin system
is `vires in numeris:'
strength in numbers.
As I just said,
there's a special numeric relationship
between the private key
and the public key:
that's one strength in numbers.
The other strength is
the number of bitcoin miners
all over the world.
Basically,
each of the bitcoin miners
verify that each other's records
are correct,
using, again,
special numeric relationships.''

``What about collusion?''
said Cheers.
``A bunch of miners could say
that the records are correct
but cheat the users.''

``There's a mathematical puzzle ---
again, strength in numbers ---
that each miner tries to solve.
The first miner that solves this puzzle
wins a number of bitcoins,
which is how bitcoins are `minted,'
so to speak.
Then that solution becomes
the template for the next mathematical
puzzle.
Now, the winner not only needs
to show the solution,
the winner also needs to show
his copy of the records.
If the winner's records are incorrect,
then his win is invalidated.''

``I don't get how that stops collusion,''
said Cheers.

``Byzantine generals,'' said Damian,
a smug grin on his face.
Marco decided to ignore it.

``Well,'' said Marco,
``it means that the losers ---
the ones who didn't guess the correct solution
to the mathematical puzzle ---
want to show a mistake in the winner's records.
If the losers can show a mistake
in the winner's records,
then the win is invalidated,
and the winner does not get the newly-minted bitcoins.
Suppose we colluded to, say,
set John's account balance to zero,
even without a valid transaction.
And then I guess the correct solution
to the mathematical puzzle.
You could then show everyone else
the errors in my records,
and I wouldn't win the bitcoins after all,
because the errors in my records would
invalidate my win.
By invalidating my win, you gain more time
to guess the correct answer to the mathematical puzzle,
increasing the chance that @emph{you} would win.
So you would @emph{want} to betray me ---
and that makes it hard for the miners to cooperate.''

Marco smiled.

@sp 2

``Hmm,'' said Cheers, "I suppose you're right.
But suppose I were to hack your computer,
or, hmm, let's say I point a gun to your head.
I could force you to cooperate with me,
winner of the bitcoin jackpot or not!''

``Well,'' said Marco, ''that's correct.
But you can't point a gun at every
bitcoin miner @emph{in the world}.
You'd need to coerce at least half
of the bitcoin miners
all over the world,
because the decision to award or not award
newly-minted bitcoins to the winner
of the mathematical puzzle
is done by what is essentially a democratic vote.
It's another theoretically possible
but practiceally unfeasible attack,
called the `fifty-one percent attack,'
as it requires you to gain control
over more than half the miners.
The bitcoin system is thus very secure,
and that security, that strength,
is derived from numbers.''

@sp 2

``Fascinating,'' said Cheers.

Marco smiled again.
``Well, any more questions about bitcoin?''

There were none.

@sp 2

There were no more questions about Marco himself,
either.

``Thank you, my good roommate Marco,'' said Cheers,
amidst the clapping of their other roommates.
``Next, then ---
Damian Carlo ex Mantis?''

@node The Hacker
@chapter The Hacker

Marco climbed back into his bunk in relief,
as Damian stood up in his place
to deliver his own Self-Introduction.

Damian shrugged, then said,
``Damian Carlo ex Mantis,
from R1.
Programmer.''

Damian just stood there,
not saying anything further,
so Cheers prompted,
``Can you tell us more about your family?''

``Computer equipment importers,''
said Damian,
an absent, faraway look
on his face.
``Typical heteronormative parents,
a father and a mother.
Older sister's married,
also R1,
also heteronormative.
Cognitivist,
her husband works for Blimp Tourism,
middle-level manager.''

Damian acted as if he'd completed
everything he wanted to say
for Self-Introduction.
He glanced at his bunk,
clearly contemplating
going back to it.

As Cheers struggled
to find a better prompt,
Marco spoke,
his voice tinged with annoyance.

``Well, can you tell us more
about programming,
at least?'' he said.

At this, a wide, feral grin lit up
Damian's features,
sweeping away his blank look.

@sp 2

``I started programming when I was ten.
Been programming for six years.
My parents run a computer equipment business.
Used to play games on the computers,
then I stumbled on a programming tutorial
for kids.
Started programming, following the tutorial.
Wrote some simple games to play with.
I found that I had more fun
writing the games
than actually playing them.
Started to stay up late,
just to program.
When my parents imposed a lights-out time,
I would wake up a little after midnight
to sneak some time on the computers.
That started my programming obsession.''

Cheers beamed.
``That's good ---''

``--- Began looking for
more tutorials
and programming articles
on the internet,''
said Damian,
as if Cheers hadn't
already started speaking.
Damian had paused only
to gather breath, apparently.
``Started working on
the more advanced stuff.
Might have ended there, actually,
once I started getting to my limits.
But then came the turning point.''

Damian paused again.

``I started participating
in online communities.
Engaging the programming community.
On the internet,
no one knows
you're not even a teenager yet.
In a programming community,
nobody even @emph{cares}
what age you are.
There's only two things
that are important.
That you build good code,
and that you're not a jerk with others.
And if you got
really really @emph{really}
good code?
Some people will tolerate
you being a jerk anyway.
As a programmer
participating in
a free or open source project,
there's only two criteria
for legitimacy:
good code,
and working with the community.''

The others let Damian ramble on,
fascinated with his sudden talkativeness
about this specific topic,
compared to his earlier, taciturn,
borderline surly answers.

``And I'm glad that
free and open source software exists.
So what if I probably won't get
ridiculously rich programming,
like Bill Gates
in the late twentieth century?
If some generous people
hadn't given away
the software source code for free
in the first place,
then there would be no
free and open source software community
in the first place.
And if there was no programming community,
then there wouldn't be anyone
to write
free and open source
programming tutorials and articles.
And if there weren't any
free programming tutorials,
I wouldn't have stumbled
on that first, beginner's programming tutorial.
I wouldn't have discovered programming at all.
I would have completely missed
being a programmer.
And I can't imagine what it would be like,
me not being a programmer.
So I give my own software,
my own source code,
so that others, too,
can discover and cultivate
their inherent skill.''

@sp 2

There was a long pause,
which Marco thought
meant that Damian had finished.

Cheers cleared his throat.
``Well,'' he said, ``that was ---''

``Wait,'' said Damian.

Cheers looked at Marco.
@emph{Please make it stop},
his expression seemed to say.

Damian spoke before anyone
could do anything.
``It's not just about programming, anymore,
you know.
It's about knowledge.
Information.
The reason why Sea State
has a vastly different approach
to copyright,
compared to other countries.
Ideas are difficult to generate,
but trivial to copy.
So the most efficient way
to handle ideas
is to copy, copy, copy.
And because of the way
the human brain works ---
as agreed upon by most cognitivists ---
the more ideas you encounter,
the more you can create.
Idea generation is not
generation from raw idea-ingredients,
idea generation is really
idea synthesis ---
combining old ideas into new ones.
Denying access to information
benefits the person
with unique knowledge,
but does not benefit
society as much.
Even putting into account
the added encouragement
of an asssured monopoly ---
more ideas will be generated,
and more people will have
more equal power and access,
if all are given
a truly free flow
of information.''

The others shifted uncomfortably;
Damian's harangue
was borderline political.

Still, they @emph{could} end up
settling on an R2 platform ---

``Well, I guess that's all,''
said Damian,
the same absent, faraway look
on his face again.
Perhaps he was already programming
in his head.

``Okay!'' said Cheers,
relief just barely hidden.
``So, anyone else have any questions?''
He glanced at Marco,
then at John.

When nobody asked anything further,
Damian shrugged,
then sat down in his bunk.

@node The Stranger
@chapter The Stranger

When Cheers called his name,
clapping,
John stood slowly,
his head down, shy.

``Hello,'' he said.
``I'm John ex Nikos.
I turned sixteen
last week.
I'm from an R2 platform,
just off the sea fertilization pumps.
My family are fishermen.''
He fidgeted,
his hands looking for pockets
in his pants,
his eyes darting between
Damian and Cheers.

Cheers smiled at John,
to encourage him.

``I'm...''
John said.
He stood straighter,
and clasped his hands
behind his back.
``I'm an only child.
I'm not very good at making friends.
Sorry.
I'm...
I've always felt a little different.
My family was never
particularly enthusiastic
about politics, you see.''

Marco glanced at Cheers.
He saw
Cheers' smile droop a little.

``I'm sorry,'' John said,
looking at Cheers.
``I know most people in the R2's
are at least a little interested
in politics.
But my parents...
well, we never really enjoyed living
on the R2 platforms,
being part of all the little
sociopolitical experiments.
But they couldn't find
any other ways
of making a living.
I know,
usually the reason
why most people
would be on an R2
is because they @emph{like}
participating in
and designing
those experiments.
I mean ---
it's not like
you can earn a lot of money
in politics,
out here in Sea State.
In other countries, you can,
but well.
So the only ones
who'd be interested
in living in an R2 platform
would be those who are
really interested in politics ---
or really desperate for any niche
to survive in.''

@sp 2

Cheers' smile looked frozen,
Marco thought.

``Sorry,'' said John.
``I'm not...
I'm not trying to imply anything,
uh, Cheers.''

``Don't worry, roommate!''
Cheers said.
``We are the new generation.
Perhaps we might eventually partner
for a better tomorrow, right?''
He gave John a thumbs-up, and smiled.

``A better tomorrow, huh?''
said John.
``I hope so.''

@sp 2

``So, John,'' said Cheers,
``what are your hopes for the future?''

``I don't know what to hope for,''
said John.
``I'm really not sure what to expect.
That's why we're here, after all,
right?''

``Right,'' said Cheers.

``Right,'' said John,
quiet.

He paused, straightened.
``I like stories, you know,''
he said.
``Novels, webcomics,
webserials, movies,
visual novels, fairy tales ---
stories.
My parents were worried, a little.
My...''
He paused,
frowning a little.
``My father ---
he would always say to me,
`Get your head out of the clouds, John.
You can't live your life in a story.'
And that's true, I suppose.
I guess I used fiction
to escape the difficulties
of my life.
I'm sorry.''

``You don't have to be sorry, you know,''
said Marco.
``I mean, stories are
one way for people
to understand the world.
If that's how you want
to handle your life ---
well, it might give you
some advantage,
some nice niche to fill.
And if that way of thinking
turns out to be completely unable
to support you ---
well, it's not like
it's the twentieth century,
when there weren't any cognitivists
to help adjust your attitudes.''

``I'm...'' John said.
``You're right, I guess.
Thank you, Marco.
I guess ---
my parents,
they were graduates of literature majors.
My father's from Chile,
my mother's from Vietnam.
They emigrated to Sea State,
for a better life,
met each other here,
fell in love.
But there wasn't much demand
for their skills.
They ---
went to the cognitivists,
of course.
It's just that my father ---
didn't trust them very much.
Didn't trust them enough
to accept their suggestions,
didn't want them
messing with his mind.
So I guess
some of that attitude
rubbed off on me.''

``Programmers of the brain,''
Damian said.
``@emph{Human} programmers,
hence fallible.
Still, better than
the `psychologists'
of the previous century.
Much more often right than wrong.''

``Yes,'' said John.
``I know.
To point to the fallibility of the source
as a reason not to follow the advice,
without looking at the @emph{rate} of error ---
that's a fallacy
that the cognitivists
have pointed out,
over and over again.
It's probably fair to say
that my parents' problem
was, mostly, culture shock.
They went to Sea State,
hoping for a better life.
Hoped to use their skills,
somehow,
as literature professors
or something similar.
But the cognitivists creeped them out,
most likely.
`Puppeteers,' my parents often called them.
So they couldn't adapt well,
to the very different way
in which Sea State operated
compared to their home countries,
and ---
well, that's it, I guess.
Story of my life.''

@sp 2

It didn't seem like a good point to end
John's Self-Introduction.
Marco searched for some prompt
to help John
end his Self-Introduction
at a more positive note.

``So, stories, huh?'' Marco said,
grasping for something positive.
``What's your favorite story?''

John smiled.
``The Hero's Journey, I guess?''
he said.

``What's that story?'' Marco said.

``Well,
the Hero's Journey isn't a story,
actually ---
it's a general way in which
a story could be written.
A pattern, something like that.
It starts with the hero,
in his ordinary world ---
usually, it's a male hero, anyway ---
generally dreaming of adventure.
To ordinary eyes,
the hero is just a perfectly ordinary man,
although, of course, he probably isn't.
Then some character ---
called the herald ---
calls upon the hero,
inviting him on an adventure.
The hero then
refuses the call,
only for the invitation
to be repeated, at a later time,
more urgently.
The hero finally decides
to go on the adventure.
But threshold guardians appear,
stopping him from continuing
on his journey.''

John paused for dramatic effect.

``The threshold guardians
are not necessarily hostile.
They may even become,
in the long run,
the allies of the hero.
But they do exist
to ensure that the hero
truly wants to go on the adventure,
and has what it takes to survive it.
They test the hero's resolve and abilities.
To their astonishment,
the hero does have what it takes
to survive his adventure,
despite their initial reluctance.
The threshold guardians
let the hero enter
the supernatural world,
a wonderful world of adventure,
where the rules are different,
and the hero must learn new skills
to survive.
And then...
everything changes in the belly of the whale.''

``Wow,'' said Damian.
``Your delivery is like Lisp,
the metastory sounds like a story.''

``Thank you,'' said John,
``although I have no idea
how it's related to lisping.
Anyway...
the belly of the whale
is the lowest point,
where the hero is, figuratively,
chewed up and eaten
by an irresistible force.
This irresistible force
is often brought into being
by some big bad enemy
that the hero
is destined
to fight and defeat.
Starting from
the belly of the whale,
the hero must accept his destiny
to defeat the big bad.
When he does, he then moves onward ---
to find his way
out of the belly of the whale
on his road of trials.''

``Then what happens?'' asked Cheers,
fascinated.

``On the road of trials
are tests, allies, and enemies,
which the hero must discern.
There's deadly terrain, monsters,
temptations to give up the quest,
deadly opposites,
often a journey to the underworld.
And then, near the end of the road,
the hero must go upon
the second-to-the-last quest
in the story,
the night sea voyage,
where the hero
sneaks into his enemy's base,
or some site that is hostile to him,
to retrieve something or someone.
Because of the risk of discovery,
he must go in the dark of night
and will often need to go,
at least part way,
by sea, or through some water ---
entering via the sewers is typical.
The hero has to do this last quest,
because what he retrieves
would make him that much more powerful
against his destined enemy.''

``Then he goes to defeat the enemy, right?''
someone asked.
It really didn't matter who did.

``Not yet,'' said John.
``The hero, and his allies,
take some time out,
to rest and recover,
and to prepare for the last stage
in the story.
The hero takes what was retrieved
in the night sea voyage
and learns from it,
often learning some key weakness
of the enemy.
When he and his allies
have prepared and rested enough,
the hero enters apotheosis,
doing something extraordinary,
becoming truly The Hero'' ---
Marco could swear
he heard the capital letters ---
``in order to fight the enemy.
During the fight,
The Hero finds that
he needs to sacrifice
something important ---
a friend, lover, or family,
or even their own lives, perhaps ---
and The Hero pauses,
weighing the decision,
knowing that much more is at stake
than what is important to him.
Then one of his allies ---
or more dramatically, a minor enemy
that changes his or her allegiance ---
sacrifices himself or herself instead.
The Hero then presses onward,
utilizing the key weakness,
and defeats the enemy,
gaining the Ultimate Boon,
the prize that
The Hero has struggled for.''

``Then?'' somebody else said.

``And then the final
and most delicate act,
the return.
It's not enough
to do the extraordinary,
become The Hero,
and defeat the enemy.
Having won the boon,
this extraordinary man,
The Hero,
must @emph{leave behind}
the world of adventure,
to return to his ordinary world:
he must relinquish his special status.
You have to have The Hero
go back to merely being
the focus character:
The Hero returns to @emph{us},
the ones who @emph{couldn't}
join the adventure.
And he returns bearing the Ultimate Boon,
to be given to all of us,
so that we can all live
happily ever after.''

Nobody spoke.
John smiled.  ``The End,'' 
he said, bowing deeply.

@sp 2

Cheers' voice was more subdued.
``Thank you, my roommate,''
he said.
``That was quite an adventure.
An excellent adventure,
given that the hero has no name
or any other detail we could find.''
He lead the rest in clapping.

``T-thanks,'' said John,
now red in the face.

``Thank @emph{you}, John!''
said Cheers.
``Well, I guess that ends
Self-Introduction ---''

Damian's computation pad beeped.
Split seconds later,
the other computation pads
started beeping.

``Ah, I guess that ends
Self-introduction,
just in time, my friends,''
said Cheers.
``And now one of our Gardeners
will address us.
We'll be deciding
where to go for the next three months,
until the next shuffling.
So let's go!''

@node The First Step of Adulthood
@chapter The First Step of Adulthood

``Hello, Seedlings,'' said the middle-aged woman
who appered
on Marco's personal computation pad
after all their fellow Seedlings
had answered the broadcast request.
``I am Renee Magnus.
I shall be one of your two Gardeners,
at least until the next shuffling.
Your other Gardener
is Sara ex Mulligan,
who, I am given to understand,
shall introduce herself next time.
Welcome to the Seedling initiation
of the R1 platform and all the R2 platforms.
We hope you are ready to begin
on your quest
to find a niche for yourselves
in Sea State.''

Renee paused, her eyes briefly glancing
away from the camera;
perhaps she was reading
her speech
from some papers.

``I trust that you have already finished
your Self-Introductions
by now.
If not, please continue later.
For now,
let me do my own Self-Introduction.
As I said, I am Renee Magnus.
Unlike all of you,
I am from the sea platform `Sweet Deep,'
near Samoa.
I volunteered myself
for our platform's
cultural exchange program,
and I decided that
the best way to experience
R1's culture
is to participate, personally,
in this institution,
the Seedling initiation program,
a program that is unique to R1
and its client platforms.''

Marco noticed Cheers sit up
on hearing their Gardener
mention the name of her sea platform.
After the collapse
of the excessively technolibertarian
Atlantic Sea State,
the only sea platforms that had
such garish names
were the scattered Dunbarite platforms.

``I hope,'' Renee continued,
``that you consider visiting
my home platform.
Or indeed any of the other
Sea State platforms
in Polynesia.
I know that traditionally,
the Seedling initiation
involves the Seedling boats
visiting various R2 platforms,
the sea fertilization pumps,
the fisheries,
and various sections of the R1 platform,
each of which may be larger
than the largest Polynesian platform.
But perhaps you might consider
something different.
Perhaps it is
on the Polynesian platforms that
you might find
your own niche.''

``Wow!'' said Cheers.
``That's a pretty direct recruitment.''
He sniggered.

``Strange,'' Marco heard Damian say from below him.
``Expected other Gardener to complain.
Rather blatant attempt
to bias our thinking.''

``Or @emph{un}bias our thinking,'' said Marco.
``I mean, I think none of us ever
thought of going to the Dunbarite platforms
for our Seedling initiation.
It @emph{is} an option,
it's just not one that comes to us
R1 and R2 kids naturally,
I suppose.''

@emph{He looked at Lizet in surprise,
the metal weight of the bitcoin in the palm of his hand,
and she whispered ``Go west, sweetheart ---''}

``Agreed,'' said Damian.
``But impractical ---''

``Which leads to what
you should be doing now,'' continued Renee,
cutting off what Damian had to say.
``You shall begin your first group decision:
where shall your boat, Seedling boat 2, go,
over the next three months,
before the next shuffling?''

She paused to emphasize the question,
letting it sink in.

Then she said,
``In the next ten minutes,
you will be given information,
compiled by the cognitivists
of the ship `Rationality One,'
which is deemed relevant
to your decision.
You shall evaluate this information,
without discussing with your peers,
until the ten minutes are up.
Then we begin the open forum.
At the open forum,
you shall discuss your destination
with your fellow Seedlings on this boat.
Open forum discussion shall be thirty minutes.
After that, you shall have the vote,
and then we will program the autopilot
to the destination you, as a group,
have decided on.
Your ten minutes
for evaluation
begins now.''

@sp 2

``Seriously?  No discussing with peers?'' said John.

Marco looked at John in puzzlement.
He saw Cheers bend over to look at John,
and no doubt Damian was probably staring at him, too.

The answer to that was so obvious ---

John shrunk at their stares.

``Standard groupthink avoidance technique,''
said Damian.
He sounded a little exasperated.
``Prevents the first ideas aired
from becoming the status quo.
This is basic rationality training stuff.
What, absent the day they taught it?''

``Sorry,'' said John, obviously deeply abashed.

``It's alright, John,'' said Marco.
He suspected that John might not actually
have gotten even basic rationality training.
Maybe John had inherited, a little,
of his parents' mistrust of the cognitivists.

Probably, the cognitivists had
drastically loosened
the bar for potential Seedlings,
given the alarming message
they had just received
from the Alugbati family,
care of Marco.

Marco decided to expand on Damian's curt
explanation.
``Basically,'' he said,
``what it means is,
people are very reluctant to propose a change
in the status quo.
And the first ideas that are ever brought up
in a group discussion
tend to become the status quo,
which people become reluctant to change.
There are two techniques to overcome the status quo bias:
the first is an individual-level technique,
where you consider that
the current status quo is highly unlikely to be correct.
Like saying that life extension is bad.
It's a bias because it implies that the current
expected longevity
is @emph{exactly} the perfect expected longevity.
Why should the @emph{perfect} expected longevity
be seventy-five years, when it could be, say,
thirty years, or one hundred fifty years?
And so on.
You focus on the fact
that it is very unlikely
that you already live in a perfect world.

``The second technique is a group-level technique,
which is, in fact, this technique.
You do not discuss your ideas @emph{immediately}
upon formulating them.
Instead, you ruminate upon them for a while,
@emph{then} you discuss.
Statistically, the initial idea
that gets fixed in your brain
is likely to be different from
the initial idea
that gets fixed in the brains
of the other group members.
This means there is no single fixed status quo,
and you each end up defending
your own, limited, status quo.
That's why all group decision techniques
follow the same basic
disputation arena template,
composed of two phases:
the centrifugal phase, where group members
come up with their own ideas initially,
and the centripetal phase,
where the ideas are put head-to-head against each other.''

``Nice, Marco!'' said Cheers.
``You memorized it from class, I guess?''

Marco shrugged.

``T-thanks,'' said John.
``Sorry for the trouble.''

Marco turned back to his computation pad
to plan out his strategy.

@sp 2

Marco's computation pad displayed
the information
that the cognitivists
had provided:
the current and projected salaries
of various possible careers,
statistics on Seedling initiations
of previous years,
GDP per capita of R1 and
the Dunbarite platforms...

@emph{Cognitivist Ricardo Derrick,
telling him, with certainty,
``I suggest you continue to follow
the literal meaning of that advice: go west.
Go west, convince your fellow Seedlings to go west,
cross the South Pacific.
Head for the Dunbarite platforms.''}

The information displayed
was irrelevant
to his goal,
Marco decided.
He needed to convince a majority
of his fellow Seedlings
to go west.

It was all based on a few vague words.
For a brief moment,
Marco wondered if he had simply @emph{misheard}.
Perhaps that phrase had
meant nothing at all...?

@emph{He looked at Lizet in surprise,
the metal weight of the bitcoin
in the palm of his hand.
There was fear in her eyes as she had whispered,
Marco remembered.
He had thought, at the time,
that the fear was only because
of the illegal and immoral giving
of the coin,
an unfair advantage
that their family could afford,
an advantage his peers could not have.
But perhaps the fear was deeper.
Perhaps the fear
was fear of the loss of R1,
its society,
and its culture.}

@sp 2

A chime from his computation pad
interrupted Marco's thoughts.
The compiled information disappeared,
to be replaced with an empty text box.
He was logged in
as the user ``@strong{u2563}''.

The first stage of their group decision
had ended.

@node Choice of Destination
@chapter Choice of Destination

Marco was thinking of what to type
when John spoke.

``Why am I logged in as `@strong{u1143}'?''
John said.

Damian just sighed, irritated.
Cheers glanced at Marco momentarily
before focusing on his computation pad
again.
@emph{All yours, roommate!} he imagined
Cheers saying.

It was getting very obvious
that John had not gone anywhere
near basic rationality training.

``It's a temporary,
randomly assigned username,''
Marco said.
``So that during the open forum,
at least,
there is some measure of anonymity.
You're not supposed to say
your temporary username to anyone,
much less broadcast it to
all your roommates.''

``Sorry,'' said John.

``After the open forum,
your temporary username will be replaced
with your real name.
The main reason is to avoid bias.
If, during the open forum itself,
you found out that an idea
is proposed by someone you liked,
then, by association,
you begin to like that idea,
despite whatever disadvantages or advantages
the idea might actually have.
Similarly if you found an idea
posted by someone you disliked:
you get a bias towards disliking the idea,
despite whatever merits it might have.
It's another groupthink avoidance technique.''

``Ah,'' said John.  ``Sorry for the trouble.''

``It's okay,'' said Marco,
giving him a thumbs-up.

He lay back more comfortably
to focus on the open forum.

Sara ex Mulligan enabled

then launched ekiga
to contact her fellow Gardener.

An unfamiliar male face answered;
most likely Renee's husband.
``Hey, Renee!'' he said.
``Call!''

The display spun momentarily
before focusing on Renee.

``Good afternoon, Sara,'' she said.

``Good afternoon,'' said Sara.
``You've seen the result of the vote?''

``A moment,'' said Renee.

Renee paused, tapping her cheek.
She spoke again.
``We will be coordinating our boats
with a flocking program.
How long would you take going there, alone?''

Sara smiled.
Many people underestimated the speed of her boat.
``I've invested in a metapulse engine
for my boat,'' she said.
``An old model, and occasionally clunky,
but workable.
As long as the flocking program
is set up to put my boat away
from the turbulence caused by
the metapulse engine of
your boat and the Seedlings' boat,
it shouldn't take more than three weeks
and a few days.''

``I see,'' said Renee.
``That should help considerably.
Well, it seems that my slight nudge
to our Seedlings
has borne fruit.''

Sara nodded.
``Yes.  Thank you.''

Sara paused, trying to think of how
to form the words.

``So aside from informing me about
the result of the vote,
why did you call me?''
said Renee,
breaking the silence.

Sara pursed her lips, then said,
``You said earlier that you suspected
military action against Sea State,
most probably due to the issue of copyright.
That Japan, and the USA, and even China
might attempt to put pressure on Sea State,
force us to follow the Berne Convention
more closely,
and to follow their rejection of
the rule of the shorter term.
Fine.
I accept that.
I haven't been following international news,
so I have to defer to your judgment.
But how long would such military action take?
It's not like we can hide forever ---
those `independent' platforms
are still part of Sea State.''

``The USA cannot formally declare war.
And most of the countries
that want to uphold the old copyright laws
have a legislature, or something similar,
that prevents them from declaring war @emph{directly}.
But creative executives can still find a way
to order military operations
against foreign countries.
I expect that the USA,
or perhaps a pawn of theirs,
will simply take over R1 directly,
probably attempting to destabilize or take over
what they consider to be the leaders of R1.
I expect that the operation itself will not require
more than a week to complete.
Most people forget that our platforms are independent.
Once R1 is under their control,
I doubt they will pursue the independent platforms.''

``So the cognitivists of Rationality One
are going to be the likely targets
of whatever operation they launch,''
said Sara,
``and all of the Dunbarite platforms, most likely,
will be safe.''

``Yes to the former.
Very likely to the latter;
there's still a chance that
they will search through
the Dunbarite platforms,
if they suspect that some perceived `leader'
has hidden there.
But merely moving away from R1
and its client platforms
buys a significant amount of safety
for your Seedlings.''

``Safe,'' said Sara.

``As safe as we can get in an uncertain world,''
said Renee.

@sp 2

Marco stepped out tentatively on deck,
together with other Seedlings.
They were about to launch.
The homeboats of their Gardeners
floated beside theirs.

Somebody tapped his shoulder.
Stephanie.

``This is Susan,'' said Steph,
pointing to a girl beside her.
``Susan ex Guillermo.
She prefers to be called Suzie.
Suzie, meet my little brother, Marco.
He's supposed to have a lot of self-control.''

``Hello,'' said Suzie,
giving him a pleasant smile,
holding out her hand.
Steph, beside her and a little behind Suzie,
smirked at Marco.

Marco smiled at the attractive girl,
making sure not to let his eyes
drift to her larger-than-average breasts.
@emph{Distract yourself, Marco.
You want to look at a
good-looking pair of round things on her?
Look at the irises of her eyes.
A nice, attractive shade of light brown.}
He shook her hand.
``A pleasure to meet you.''
He looked around for his roommates,
failed to see them.

Then he saw Cheers a short distance away,
introducing himself to some fellow Seedlings.

A woman emerged from the cabin of
one of the Gardener's homeboats ---
the older homeboat,
the one that was probably on an electric motor.
She wasn't Renee Magnus,
so logically, it was probably Sara ex Mulligan.

Sara stepped up from her boat,
crossing the short ladder connecting it
to the Seedling's boat,
then stood at the line dividing
the public-use and private parts
of the deck.

``Hello, Seedlings,'' said Sara.
``I am Sara ex Mulligan,
one of the Gardeners currently assigned
to your boat.
You have voted on your first destination.
With your permission, I shall now program
the autopilot of your boat.
My boat, as well as Renee's,
will be programmed as flock members
of your boat.''

The Seedlings parted to let her pass.

@sp 2

After having lunch with Steph and Suzie,
Marco set about to explore the boat more.

The seedlings were on their way west.

He saw a door,
labelled `3-D Printer',
and smelled the familiar smell of
melted plastic.
Somebody was already using the
3-D printer.

He knocked, then opened the door.
There was a person inside.

To his surprise,
it was someone he knew.
John ex Nikos.

``H-hello,'' John said.
He stood as if to block
Marco's view
of the 3-D printer.

``Hello!'' said Marco.
``Making something already?''

``Uh, yes,''  John shifted.
``Something to decorate my bunk with,
at least.''

Marco tiptoed to glance
at the 3-D printer
over John's shoulder.
It was a RepRap model ---
a @emph{rep}roducing @emph{rap}id-prototyper.
The RepRap was composed primarily
of sturdy plastic bars,
forming a triangular prism.
The print head was mounted
across a bar
that was currently midway up
its side;
various motors among the bars
controlled the print head's movement.
At its bottom was the printing plate,
where something ---
as yet indistinct ---
was already started.
A cable connected it to the nearby computer.

``You've started using your allocation
of R3PP?''
A long spool of Reusable 3-D Printer Plastic
was among the standard-issue items
in the Seedling knapsack,
together with a small bottle of melter
that could be used with the
recycling machine beside the RepRap,
to transform a 3-D printed object
back to reusable plastic.

``Yes,'' said John.
``Is that okay?''

``Yes, it's okay.
What are you making?''

``Well...
I always wanted to try out
using a RepRap.
I downloaded a conch-shell design
from @url{www.thingiverse.com},
made some adjustments.
I've always been fascinated by the RepRaps,
you see.
It's like,
you can have an idea,
and by this device,
you can turn that idea
into an tactile, physical thing.
From ideal to actual.''

Marco looked at John again.
RepRaps were very commonplace,
they literally reproduced themselves ---
RepRaps could print out their own components,
and they were simple enough to
assemble by hand,
once the components were there.
They were rather ordinary items,
to the point of being positively
@emph{boring}.

To most Sea State citizens,
at least.

RepRaps were very slow,
and they were outcompeted
by ordinary industrial facilities
on land,
many of which had started to incorporate
some of the RepRap's technological advances.
Outside of Sea State,
only enthusiasts used RepRaps.

Sea State's
lack of developed industrial facilities ---
due primarily to its lack of actual land
to build those facilities on ---
meant that RepRaps
were in everyone's homeboats.

``Is it okay?'' asked John,
interrupting Marco's thoughts.
He sounded worried,
his eyes darting between
the working machine
and Marco.

Marco focused on John, again.
He almost didn't ask the question
that was nagging at him.
He forced himself onward, anyway.
``John, let me ask you something,'' he said.
``Although the answer seems pretty obvious to me.
You don't have basic rationality training,
and you are acting as if
you never read anything about
the Seedling program.
You are acting as if you've never seen
a RepRap every day of your life
since you were born.
And I have some secondary information
that I won't reveal right now,
but it increases the possibility
that what I suspect is true.
You're not actually
a Sea State citizen,
are you?''

@sp 2

``Is it that obvious?'' asked John,
worry carved on his face.

``Well... not really,'' said Marco.
``I suppose the others think
you just didn't pay attention
to basic rationality training
or something.
And they're not here to see you
gush about 3-D printing.
To most of us,
it's about as interesting
as, I don't know,
industrial manufacturing and packaging.
Once you've watched a RepRap build
everyone's toothbrushes once every two months,
it gets to be boring after a while.
I'd expect most people would go here,
set up the RepRap to build whatever,
then let their pads notify them
when the RepRap's finished.''

John lowered his head.
``I like sculpting, you see,''
said John.
``I studied it a little.
I found it difficult,
even though I had good hand-eye coordination.
It's just that my ideas
were often a bad fit
to the materials I had on hand.
So, when I heard about 3-D printing
and RepRaps,
I thought it might be a way
to get my ideas into reality
much better.
I studied everything I could get
about them.
Learned the important advantages
of additive manufacturing
over traditional,
subtractive manufacturing ---
you know,
3-D printing versus
sculpting and molding techniques.
Afterward,
I wanted to get a RepRap,
but, well...''

John's voice trailed off.
He was watching the RepRap
as it worked,
caressing it.

``Your parents didn't want to get
a 3-D printer,''
said Marco.
``Because it would be impractical
in a land-based,
properly industrialized country.
Which is where you'd be from,
if you're not a Sea State citizen.''

``Yes,'' said John.  He sighed.

Marco thought for a while.
He suspected that
John's parents did not
give him permission,
or anything remotely like it,
to go to a foreign country
and join its initiation rites
for prospective adults.

A teenager who could do that
probably did not feel
a deep attachment to his parents.
Marco chose his next response
to test his hypothesis.
To properly test it,
it would have to assume
the opposite of
what his hypothesis stated,
so that its negation provided
evidene for his hypothesis.

``Your parents might have been hoping
that you'd become a famous sculptor.
So they decided not to give you a RepRap,
because it would have been a crutch
on your budding skills.''

John's face darkened.
He looked directly at Marco,
eyes sharp with emotion.
``I had to study sculpturing
in my spare time,
hiding from my parents.
My father thought it was a waste of time.
@emph{Everything I did},
it was a waste of time.
Writing stories, sculpturing,
3-D printing, everything.
He wanted me to focus
on what they were doing.
He kept saying to me,
`Making things is less important
than controlling the people who make them.
You make one thing, that's all you get.
You control the makers,
you get everything they make.'
Control?
More like coerce!''

That confirmed Marco's hypothesis.

``So,'' he said,
``can you give me your @emph{real}
Self-Introduction now?''

The light ---
the burning fire ---
faded from John's face.
``I'm...''
He stopped.

Marco waited patiently.

``I'm from Chile,''
John said.
``My parents are...
well, my mother is from Vietnam,
that's true.
She was a ---
she was selected by father
and brought into Chile.
My father is a high-ranking politician.
That's one of the reasons
I went here ---
I heard how different
politics is
in Sea State.
My father is ---
he's not the most corrupt politician,
that's true,
but he is definitely no angel.
In the provinces of Chile,
lots of things happen
that never manage to get reported
in the press.
He's got his own personal army ---
they're technically bodyguards and aides,
but we know what they actually do.
There's a vigilante group
which operates in my father's province
that owes a few favors to him, too.
Favors.
Hate that word.''

Marco nodded, keeping silent
to encourage John to continue.

``He's a devout Catholic.
Or acts as if he's one, anyway.
And he...
he's not anywhere near good,
anyway.
There are a lot of reasons
for me to get out of there.
I'm not proud of my family,
you know.
If I went anywhere else,
maybe they --- he ---
could still reach me.
But here ---
there's a good chance he won't.''

``Okay...''

``He thinks Sea State is damned.
Because of the `puppeteers,'
the cognitivists,
with their denial of the existence
of souls
and the restricted form of free will
in the cognitivist mindset.
That's true,
at least,
my father really does call them puppeteers.
As if he isn't an even worse puppeteer.
At least the cognitivists
try to improve
the greater number of people,
instead of just benefiting themselves.
I left a note
about how I was going to Sea State,
to Rationality One.
How I planned to talk to the cognitivists directly.
I @emph{think} he won't try to get to me here.
Because he thinks I've joined
the ranks of the damned,
just by going here.''

``What if he doesn't?
Maybe he loves you more than
you think he does.''

John smiled,
as if the idea was preposterous.
``I think I know my father well.
I've lived with him.
And ---
and there's a lot of reasons
that he doesn't want
to consider me his son, you know.
So I'm fairly confident he won't try.
He'll probably tell my mother
to never mention me again.
Probably already has.
You want to know something?
When I heard Cheers talk about
his family so happily,
it's like my family is
a dark mirror,
a dark opposite to his.''

John sat down on the seat again.

``You won't tell anyone?''
said John.
``Please?''

``I won't.''

``T-thank you.''

Marco looked at him silently,
listening to the RepRap print
the conch-shell design.
Then he said,
``It's just that there's a lot
you don't know
about how Sea State operates.
For example,
even the Dunbarite platforms ---
the platforms we're going to ---
all expect their adult citizens
to have taken basic rationality training
at some point.
It's a de facto part of the Sea State Agreement,
even the most separationist Dunbarites
won't contest it.
The few slip-ups you've had won't tag you @emph{yet},
nobody's perfect,
but the more slip-ups you have,
the more people will suspect
that you don't have basic rationality training.
I can help you with that.''

John smiled.  It didn't reach his eyes.
``In exchange for what?''
he said.

John's body was tilted slightly back,
radiating a sense of suspicion,
of mistrust.

Marco blinked.
It took him a while
to understand.
``You hate favors, eh?'' he said.
``It's not a favor.
Or ---
here.''
He held out his hand.
``I'm your roommate.
Maybe we can be more than that.
We can be friends.
No tracking of favors,
just someone you can ask for help
when you need it.
And I assure you,
you need a lot of help
if you don't want to let it slip
that you're not from an R2 platform,
like you told us.''

Marco waited, patient,
his hand still held out.

John shook his head.
``Let me try for myself.
Just a little.
If I fail ---
then maybe I'll ask for your help.''

Marco put down his hand,
taking care to stop
his disappointment, embarassment, and frustration
from reaching his face.
@emph{Don't pressure him.
And you can always keep an eye out,
step in later,
if it gets disastrous.
Think of alternative means
of helping him.}
He forced himself to smile,
crinkled his eyes
to convince himself,
or at least a part of himself,
that he was not unhappy about it.

In a way, he also wanted to have a genuine friend.
Someone he could trust
to tell about the physical bitcoin,
about his parents,
and about the meaning of `go west.'
@emph{So I guess my motives aren't so pure,
after all.}

``It's fine,'' he said.
``And you can trust me not to tell anyone.''

He bowed slightly and left,
closing the door carefully behind him.

@sp 2

The same mood still gripped him
when he arrived back at room 2.
Cheers' and John's bunk was empty;
Damian was seated comfortably in his,
typing something, probably programming.

``Hello,'' said Marco.

Damian didn't respond immediately.

When he did,
a distracted ``Hmm?''
was all Damian said.

@emph{Not someone I'd be able to
talk to enough
to confide in,
I guess,}
thought Marco.

Marco climbed up to his bunk.
He remembered @strong{u3649},
who had given him advice
on how to convince the others
to go to the Dunbarite platforms
of Polynesia and Micronesia.

By this time,
the anonymization would have been removed.
He should be able to find out
who @strong{u3649} really was.
He enabled his computation pad
to look for the real identity of @strong{u3649}.

A tiny part of him hoped that it was Suzie.
Susan ex Guillermo.
It would be good to talk to her,
get another chance to look at her...
beautiful brown irises.

He looked for login name @strong{u3649}
in the master list.

Then he tried to look at the private messages
he'd sent to @strong{u3649}.

He looked at the master list again,
unable to believe what he was seeing.

Or rather, what he wasn't seeing.

As far as the system was concerned,
there never was a @strong{u3649},
and he'd never sent or received messages
from anyone logged in
using that name.

@node The Mushroom at the End of R1
@chapter The Mushroom at the End of R1

Lancer ex Caballeros,
ex-admiral of the Sea Strikers,
stood on the deck of his homeboat,
admiring how the advertisements
showed well in the evening.

As he looked up,
he thought he saw something move
in the night sky.

Advertising was, in retrospect,
the best way to privatize armies,
without making them into @emph{private} armies,
owned and controlled by the highest bidder.
The same way that other public resources,
such as radio stations,
news sites,
web search engines,
and others
had been privatized:
by advertising.

Not so long ago,
Rationality One had maintained
a working navy,
the only one that the Pacific Sea State had
in any capacity.
It was a necessity,
an evil that the cognitivists of Rationality One
had accepted,
the Leviathan
that ensured
that citizens of R1
did not go around murdering each other.

Not having a public army was what
had ultimately lead
to the collapse of their sister country,
the North Atlantic Sea State.
Strict adherence to the ideals of
anarcho-techno-libertarianism ---
passing everything through
the operation of the free market,
without government intervention
and supported by
growing advances in technology ---
prevented the formation of a public army.
Without an analogue to the police force,
ordinary citizen began to prey
on their fellow citizens.
Often by hiring @emph{private} armies
to harass them.

The cognitivists bent their idealogy,
conforming to the evidence of reality.
They formed a public army,
a navy that served as police
and army.

But even public armies
tended to be destabilizing,
since there was always the risk
of a military coup.
And that power,
that ability to threaten coup,
meant that army leaders
were in a position
to ask for bribes ---
bribes to avoid military takeovers.
Hence, a source of corruption.
The cognitivists recognized that,
and took steps
to prevent it.

But it was a known evil,
something accepted,
for then,
because it stopped an even greater evil:
the utter collapse of society.

And then an enterprising young man,
Lancer ex Caballeros,
figured out
how to privatize armies
while aligning their interests
with the public.

Advertising.

It was a technique,
a technology,
that aided the ideals of
anarcho-libertarianism.

A private navy
that did something ---
anything ---
that went
against public interest
would become unpopular.
And no company would want
their trademarks associated
with an unpopular navy.
They would withdraw
their advertising contracts,
leaving the navy without
a source of funding.
Protecting that revenue stream
meant that private navies
had to ensure good public relations.
And meant that they adhered
to the expected laws and customs
of Sea State.

A private navy that attempted
to gain @emph{direct} control
over their revenue --
a military takeover
or a harassment without just cause ---
was branded a ``pirate navy.''
Other private navies
would then band together
to eradicate the pirates,
to protect the reputation
of all advertising-revenue navies.

In the early days,
they were effectively lead by
Rationality One's public navy.
But as the number and strength of
the private navies grew,
the public navy began to have
an increasingly peripheral role.
When the cognitivists measured
the relative advantages of the new style
of private navies,
and found them a better fit
to anarcho-libertarian ideals,
Rationality One disbanded its public navy.
Taxes were reduced,
to the joy of many.

The new advertising private armies
also helped start
the Dunbarite movement.
The R2 platforms
had huddled around R1,
to keep within the umbrella
of Rationality One's
public navy.
But once the new,
advertising-revenue private navies
got started,
some of the separationist
R2 platforms
spread out across the South Pacific,
turning themselves into
the Dunbarite platforms
of Polynesia,
each one proud of
having their own platform names
and their own, idiosynchratic cultures.
They trusted the growing number of
private navies
that patrolled their platforms
and the seas around
and between them.

So Lancer,
even though he was retired,
still put his old navy's advertisements
on his own homeboat.
It was the achievement of a lifetime,
his legacy to Sea State.

It was fitting that he was one of the few
who glimpsed R1's doom fall on Rationality One
that night,
just a few days
after the Seedling boats
had left,
to bring their Seedlings
to their destiny.

It was not fitting that he was,
like most of R1's citizens,
one of the many who died that night.

The thing he had seen earlier
streaked through the night sky,
heading for Rationality One.

@sp 2

@c yay nuclear explosion!!!
@c coz why the hell not??

The nuclear warhead
that fell upon R1
on that fateful night
was not intelligent.
It didn't have to be.

Its path had been precomputed.
It would simply follow the instructions
programmed into it,
and it would reach its destination.

Ideally, any object
travelling on Earth
would follow either a parabolic arc
or an ellipse, an orbit around Earth.
Of course,
the Earth had an atmosphere.
Near its launch and its destination,
it would encounter significant air resistance
due to the higher density of air.
As the warhead arced into the upper reaches
of the atmosphere,
it would encounter less air resistance.

This had already been considered,
its path already computed
to take this into account.
Whatever minor, invisible effect
that the local winds had
was simply accepted as a small,
limited,
ultimately controllable
error factor.

In the upper reaches of the atmosphere,
it would arguably already be in space.
There, external radiation,
from the sun and other sources in the galaxy,
would hit it.
Far greater radiation
than any device on Earth's surface
would ever expect to encounter.
This had also been considered
by the designers of the missile.
Whatever meager electronics it had
was protected well
against the onslaught of
the flood of
radioactive particles
in space.

It reached its destination
at the precomputed time.
Its circuits activated.

@sp 2

Smaller, ordinary chemical explosives
surrounded the core,
the nuclear heart
of the warhead.
With careful timing,
the circuits controlling the missile
detonated the chemical explosive
in a fixed,
predetermined manner.

If one of those chemical explosives failed
to detonate in the right sequence,
at the right timing,
the core would not reach critical mass
and the missile,
for all intents and purposes,
would be little more than
a very expensive,
ordinary, explosive
intercontinental ballistic missile.

But the simplicity of its electronics
ensured its reliability.
It was very, very unlikely to fail.

The chemical explosives pushed
the core, a large sphere,
into a smaller sphere,
at the requisite timing.
This core entered critical mass.

Each second,
a few thousand plutonium atoms
in the core
would split ---
@emph{fissioned} was the term
used by physicists ---
into smaller atoms,
as well as a few stray neutrons.

In a core that was not
in critical mass,
almost all of the neutrons
would fly out of the core,
not hitting anything,
until they reached the protective sphere
surrounding the core.

But when the core was compressed,
the plutonium atoms pressed against each other.
Almost all the stray neutrons
hit other plutonium atoms.

The plutonium atoms hit by neutrons
became even more unstable
than they already,
inherently,
were.
Many more of them would split
into smaller atoms
and more neutrons.

Perhaps a few stray plutonium atoms,
by the strange, counterintuitive laws
of quantum physics,
did not destabilize.
Some minor probability, some minor chance,
kept those few plutonium atoms from splitting.
But in the face of what happened next,
their luck was short-lived.

Neutrons flooded the core.
As more and more of their neighbors
self-destructed,
plutonium atoms began splitting,
left and right.
Nothing would help,
@emph{could} help,
against the onslaught of neutrons
hitting those few lucky,
extra-stable plutonium atoms.

A few thousand plutonium atoms
splitting in a second
would warm the core very, very slightly.

But as more and more neutrons
destabilized more and more plutonium atoms,
many, many more plutonium atoms
would destabilize and split,
bringing their neighbors
closer to destruction.
Millions more plutonium atoms split.
Then billions more.
Then trillions more.

The core became very, very, very warm.
Billions of times warmer,
as the destruction
of plutonium atoms
sped up,
causing many more plutonium atoms
to self-destruct.

By the time all the plutonium atoms
in the missile's core had split,
the temperature of the core
had exceeded the temperature
of the surface of the sun.

A miniature sun blossomed in the midst of R1.

@sp 2

Heat has a tendency to expand objects.
The higher the heat,
the greater the expansion.

The compressed core expanded,
then expanded even more,
the heat it generated spreading
over a wider and wider area.

The time it took for the heat to spread
was far smaller than a millisecond.
The people on ground zero
never felt the heat.
The heat flew faster
than the signals from their pain receptors
could flow through their nerves
and reach their brains.
By the time the signal
would have reached their brains,
their brains had already been boiled
in its own juices,
then fried,
then simply burned
and eradicated
as even more heat spread
from the nuclear warhead.

The seawater near ground zero
reached boiling point,
then went even further.
It blew into superheated steam.
Seawater far below ground zero evaporated.

The hot air around ground zero
and the steam expanded.
Heat tended to expand things,
after all.
As the air and the steam expanded,
its density dropped.
Far less dense than the air above it,
the hot air and the steam rose upward,
cooling all along the way,
forming a large column.

As the column of
superheated air and steam rose
far into the upper atmosphere,
the air and steam at the edge
of the column cooled,
faster than the air
near the center of column.
The air and steam at the edges
spread out a little as it rose.
The air and steam at the center
rose slightly faster,
being slightly warmer.
The mass of air reached a height
where the surrounding air's density
matched its own,
staying at that level.
The mass of superheated air
formed a roundish shape,
its edges spread out,
its center somewhat higher.

The column of hot air
and the round shape at the top
formed the distinctive mushroom shape
of any sufficiently-large explosion.

The mushroom that grew on R1
was the largest mushroom
that humankind had ever learned to grow.

@sp 2

At sea level, many more things happened
as a consequence of the heat buildup
in the nuclear warhead's core.

The water under ground zero,
in boiling,
left an empty space in its wake.
It was a void waiting to be filled
by the right material:
even more seawater.

Many tonnes of seawater moved,
rushing to fill the void
left by the boiled water.
Inevitably,
more water would try to go in
than was necessary to fill the gap.

The excess water formed a small column
at ground zero,
rising underneath the mushroom.

Inevitably, gravity would force
that column of water
back down towards Earth.

The water falling down
displaced more water,
creating a tremendous tidal wave,
spreading out around ground zero.

The tidal wave spread out,
destroying and overturning homeboats.
Even many of those
far from the explosion itself,
and who could have survived, possibly,
drowned as the tidal wave
overtook them.
Those who survived
could only cling to the wreckage of their homeboats.
The wreckage of their lives.

And yet, even as the wave of destruction spread,
it grew smaller, weaker.
The same amount of power
stretched over a wider circumference.

By the time the wave reached the shores of Chile,
it was barely larger than the wind-blown waves
that evening.

@sp 2

Around the core was the chemical explosives
that triggered its critical mass.
Around @emph{that} was the protective sphere,
which absorbed excess neutrons and radiation.
It ensured that a nuclear warhead,
before its explosion,
was not much more radioactive
than a banana.
It protected the core from exploding,
by absorbing the destabilizing neutrons,
ensuring that not even powerful hits,
or gunshots,
would trigger a nuclear warhead.

When the core exploded,
the protective sphere was blasted
into smithereens.

Radioactive by-products and neutrons
spread out,
without the beryllium sphere
to contain them.

The nuclear explosion spread those
radioactive materials
far from their source.
The mushroom cloud
and the tidal wave
carried its own share
of radioactivity.
Many of those who survived
the actual heat explosion
received far too much radiation,
killing them in hours, minutes,
@emph{seconds}.

Those further away
received a dose
that would reduce their lives
by a few years.
It increased their chances of cancer
slightly,
down the road.

@sp 2

Gamma rays from the nuclear explosion
produce high-energy electrons.
Those electrons spread out,
forming an electromagnetic wavefront ---
an electromagnetic pulse of energy.

This pulse causes high voltages to be generated
in electronic equipment.
Voltages too high for them to tolerate.

Increasingly, human lives are governed by electronics.

Many citizens of Sea State
do not actually know how to navigate
their own homeboats.
They depend upon
open-source navigation programs.
Programs requiring working computers ---
working electronic equipment ---
to exist, in order to work.

Many of their homeboats
depended on complex electronics
to operate their engines properly.
Of the minority
who could actually navigate,
many more were left stranded
as the electromagnetic pulse
passed over them,
their engines destroyed,
rendering their
homeboats immobile,
their skill at navigation useless.

Many of them,
drifting in their dead homeboats,
consumed all their food resources,
and slowly starved to death
before they could be rescued.

@sp 2

This was not the extent
of the result
of the nuclear explosion.

Normally, naturally,
water evaporated from the oceans.

Normally, naturally,
the evaporated water
would rise
into the upper atmosphere,
then condense into clouds.
In the height of summer,
a lot of water would evaporate,
forming large, tall clouds.

Large clouds,
pulled by Coriolis forces,
would spin.
The largest of these clouds
formed over the Pacific ocean.
As they grew even larger,
they would spin faster,
forming a distinctive `eye,'
air spinning too fast
for water to condense properly.
Outside the eye,
water would condense very fast,
pouring down in tremendous sheets,
the most powerful rains on Earth.

The Chinese called them @emph{tai fung},
great wind.

Abnormally, unnaturally,
the superheated steam
around ground zero
brought evaporated water ---
a @emph{lot} of evaporated water ---
into the atmosphere.
Far more water than most typhoons
fed on.

The largest supertyphoon
in recent history formed,
practically overnight,
at the graveyard
of sea platform R1.

@node The Gardeners Reconsider
@chapter The Gardeners Reconsider

Renee Magnus was already deeply asleep,
snug in her bed,
when her husband woke her up.

``Renee,'' he said,
``something's happened.''

He was sweating, badly.
They had installed a powerful
air-conditioning unit
in their cabin,
because he sweated profusely
even in mild heat.
Renee, comfortable at a warmer temperature,
just piled on more blankets
to compensate.

Removing her blankets,
Renee felt the biting cold
in their cabin.
Something
other than heat
had caused her husband's sweating,
then.

He waved one of their computation pads
in front of her.

She took the pad
and began reading
about R1's untimely demise.

@sp 2

Renee had barely manged
to wrap her head
around the terrible news
when Sara ex Mulligan called her
via ekiga.

``You've heard the news?''
said Sara.
She looked like a mess;
hair unkempt,
eyebags under her bloodshot eyes.

Renee suspected that she, herself,
was a similar mess.

``I just did,''
said Renee.
``This is far worse than we expected.''

``Much worse.''

``I suppose we are very fortunate
to be a good distance away
from R1.''

Sara nodded in reply.
There was silence for a moment.

Finally, Sara said,
``There are a few things ---
a few favors ---
I'd like to ask.''

``Yes?'' said Renee.

``The Seedling boat
has an internet connection
via satellite.
I'm connected to the Seedling boat's network
as a public-use account,
which is rate limited to use a maximum of 1%
of the Seedling boat's available bandwidth.
I want to download the entire English Wikipedia.
The destruction of R1
means the destruction of all reserve funds
of the Seedling project,
@emph{including the funds
for the internet connection.}
So the Seedling boat may get disconnected
due to lack of funds
some time soon.
Before that happens,
I want to have the English Wikipedia
as a local copy here.
Do you have your own internet connection?''

Renee shook her head.
``No.  We are also dependent
on the Seedling boat's internet connection.
We can also start downloading Wikipedia articles,
so at least we can get 2%
of the Seedling boat's bandwidth
together.
Let's coordinate with a parallel download program?''

``Okay,'' said Sara.
``I guess we'll have to ask the Seedlings directly
for better bandwidth allocation
while we still have internet.
The next favor I'd like to ask is,
would you mind taking me on your homeboat?''

``Why?  There is some damage to your homeboat?''

``No, it's just that it's much too slow.
Weather reports indicate a massive supertyphoon
forming at the site of the explosion.
Simulations show that it will reach our general area
in one or two days.
According to the simulations,
we should head due north.
My boat is too slow,
even if we head north now,
but if it's not included in the flocking program,
your homeboat
and the Seedling boat
will be fast enough
that we will get hit
only by the edges of the storm,
and there's a good chance
we'll avoid it completely.
Hopefully, we'll be able to weather that.''

``Is the storm radioactive?''

``For now, yes.
But its strength also means
that almost all of the radioactive material
will be dumped by rain
in less than a day.
By the time it reaches our location,
it will only be slightly more radioactive
than background.
Not much more dangerous than sunbathing
for an hour without sunblock.
At least according to the simulation.''

``I thought your homeboat has a metapulse engine?''

``An old model, kludged into my boat,
so it's not as fast as the recent models.
This boat's not exactly designed
for metapulse,
either;
one of the metapulse tubes is a dummy.
It's not fast enough to get out
of the storm's possible radius.''

``I see,'' said Renee.
``In that case, you're certainly welcome
to live with us.''

``I'll just stay on your public-use deck,''
said Sara.
``I did that before, when I was younger,
before I scrounged up enough money
to buy this old boat.''

``Nonsense, Sara, I refuse to let you
be a public-use loafer.
I shall consider it a charitable act
to give you shelter for free.''
She paused to enable a lawyer program,
entered her private key to attest to it.
She read the prompted words.
``I, Renee Magnus,
a citizen adhering to the Sea State Agreement,
declare that this charitable act ---
specifically, to allow the individual
Sara ex Guillermo
to take shelter
in the private part of the homeboat
owned jointly by the Magnus family ---
is entered into and decided upon
by my own will,
and that I waive my inherent right
to a fair exchange of resources
specifically for this aforementioned case.''

She was confident that
she could bend her husband
to agreeing to it.
The lawyer program
generated the contract file,
which Renee sent
to Sara.

``Thank you,'' said Sara,
upon receiving the file.
``Unfortunately, I don't have
a portable computation device ---
I'll be leaving the computer
on this boat.
I'll just send the contract
to an online archive.
Are you sure it's not too much trouble?
I've been an actual public-use loafer,
I can adapt.''

``I shall not hear of this,''
said Renee.
``We have a spare bunk.
My husband sometimes sleeps in it
since I often toss and turn too much
when I sleep,
but I expect he shall manage well enough.
You can sleep in the spare bunk.
Our cabin will be very cold,
as my husband is more comfortable that way,
but we have enough spare blankets
if you find it uncomfortable.
Besides, as you said,
we may still be caught
by the edge of that supertyphoon.
It is not safe to be just on deck
for that.''

Sara smiled.
``It's amazing what a little rope
and a bowline knot
can do during a storm.''

Renee smiled in reply.
``Touch@'e.
But you shall stay with us.
I insist.''

``Thank you, Renee.
And thank your husband for me.
I have a another favor to ask.''

``Yes?''

``We need to head due north @emph{now}.
Or in an hour, at the most.''
She checked something on her computer.
``Fifty-four minutes from now at most,
to be precise.
That means we need to disengage
the flocking program,
on the Seedling boat.
We need to wake them up.''

``I'll help you,'' said Renee.

``Strangely enough,
as it happens,
none of the computation pads
on board the Seedling boat
appear to be enabled.
Everyone on board
appears to be asleep,
or otherwise not interested
in the computation pads.
We'll need to sound
the fire alarm to wake them up.''

``Let's do it now.''

``I wish we could at least
let them have
a full night's sleep
without this ---
terrible news ---
hanging over their heads.
But we need to change course now,
and we need to coordinate with the Seedlings.
We need to wake them up.
You'll tell them?''

``It is my turn already, is it not?''
said Renee.

@node Fallout
@chapter Fallout

Drowsy, half-awake,
Marco heard a strange,
wailing sound.

Two wailing sounds, in fact.

Then suddenly he was wide awake,
realizing that the two wailing sounds
were two overlapping `boat on fire' alarms.

Marco and his roommates scrambled messily
out of their bunks.
Outside their room,
other Seedlings were walking
in the corridor
heading outside.
Joining them,
Marco looked out at the two
nearby homeboats
of their Gardeners.

Neither boat was burning.

Their small fleet was still travelling,
controlled by the flocking program.
Nothing was obviously wrong.
The wind blew some girl's hair
into Marco's face.
The girl had a slight misstep,
which resulted in her stepping on
Marco's little toe.
She did not apologize.

He did not yet know that
these moments
would be etched into his memory,
so he indulged in
no small amount of annoyance
at that girl.

The alarm shut off.

``False alarm?'' someone asked.

In the silence after the alarm shut off,
Marco heard a computation pad beep.
It was Damian, who apparently thought
that the proper response
to a `boat on fire' alarm
was to bring @emph{and turn on}
his computation pad.

Marco, John, and Cheers had had
to practically coerce Damian
to turn off the thing
instead of staying up
to the wee hours of the morning
programming.
Lack of sleep made Damian grouchy
and even less sociable
than usual.
At least with a good night's sleep,
he'd been a little more normal yesterday.

That was what Marco was thinking about,
at that time.
After all, he did not yet know
that he would remember this moment
for the rest of his life.

Renee appeared on Damian's pad.
Damian raised it up,
to let the other Seedlings see.

Some semi-conscious part of him
noticed how the light from the computation pad
lit up a small circle of Seedlings.
That detail, too,
would become indelibly etched in his memory.

``Hello, Seedlings,'' said Renee.
``We apologize for waking you all up
at this hour.
A horrible incident has occurred.
And we need to handle the ---
fallout ---
from that incident.''

Dread stealing over his heart,
Marco waited for Renee
to say what had occured.

@emph{There are --- some organizations of Sea State,
with particular code words.
Your parents are part of
one of those organizations.
A part of that code,
`go west', has a particular meaning.
It means: `prepare for imminent war.'}

Perhaps war had already been declared.

He hoped that Rudy and Rayne and Mike
and Lizet and Maria and Red were safe.
He hoped Lancer ex Caballeros was safe too.
He wondered if Cognitivist Ricardo Derrick
had evacuated Rationality One
and as much of R1 and the R2's as they could.

He would remember that moment,
that heartfelt hope
that the people he had known
would be safe.

Then Renee told them what happened,
and all of Marco's hopes were smashed,
in a manner that only a nuclear explosion
could do.

The exact words Renee said
would forever slip Marco's mind.
It was only the knowledge that he could remember.
The knowledge of utter devastation.

@sp 2

There were gasps, wails,
exhortations of disbelief,
of pain,
terror,
fear,
sorrow,
anger.

``Please, Seedlings,'' Renee said.
``There are still some things we must do.
The nuclear explosion
has triggered the formation
of a supertyphoon.
That typhoon will head westward,
and will reach our fleet,
unless we head north now.
Please disable the flocking program
on your boat.''

Someone ---
several someones ---
rushed to the control room,
to disable the flocking program.
The Seedling boat began to slow.

``We shall dock with your boat,''
said Renee,
``and tell you more.
Sara ex Mulligan, your other Gardener,
will jettison her homeboat,
as it is too slow.
She will ride onboard my homeboat.
We need to head due north
within forty minutes.''

Renee paused.

``My condolences, citizens of R1,''
she said,
before disconnecting.

@sp 2

In ten minutes, the two Gardeners' homeboats
had finished docking on opposite sides
of Seedling boat 3.

Renee climbed the ladder
leading from her homeboat
onto the Seedling boat's
public-use deck.
She faced the crowd.

Behind her, Sara brought a bag
of her belongings.
Renee's husband climbed up
to get the bag,
and Sara returned to her boat,
to get more of her things.

``Seedlings,'' said Renee,
``citizens of R1,
earlier last night,
at around 2000h R1 local time,
a tactical nuclear fission warhead
was detonated at Rationality One.
It is not yet known
who detonated this warhead,
although the United States
and Mexico
are confirmed
to have declared war
on Sea State,
and unconfirmed reports state
that the nuclear strike
had been from the United States.
The nuclear explosion destroyed
the sea platform R1 completely.
As I also mentioned,
a supertyphoon is forming
around the site,
triggered by the nuclear explosion.

``The liquid assets of the Fourth Seedling Company
were deposited as a traditional bank account
on R1 Bank.
The main office of R1 Bank was destroyed,
and R1 Bank faces bankruptcy.
The account is insured ---
by Rationality One Insurance Corporation,
whose main office has also been destroyed,
and which also faces bankruptcy.
Also,
we have been unable to contact
the other Seedling boats.
It seems likely that the Fourth Seedling Company's
entire assets
are this boat,
and the possessions you all currently have.''

@emph{And }use@emph{ that coin.
Its value is far, far more than a mere
one hundred bitcoins.}

``Who could care about money at a time like this?''
somebody, possibly a male, wailed.
``What about our @emph{families}?''

``You are prospective adults, Seedlings.
You @emph{must} worry about how your future
will unfold,
@emph{most especially}
at a time like this.
You @emph{must} care about the money,
at a time like this,
because that money is a measure of power,
with which you will be able to take control
of your future.
Citizens of R1, realize this:
Except for a few tourists,
you, and Sara ex Mulligan,
may very well remain the only citizens of R1
@emph{in the whole world}.
Most of the R2 platforms survived,
but the war with
the most powerful military in the world
may mean that they will get picked off,
one by one,
unless the R2 platforms disband.

``And there is a more important and pressing detail.
Your internet service account
is paid for from the R1 Bank account.
With the account frozen
and the funds very likely lost,
your internet service cannot be paid for.
It's possible that we will lose
the only outside connection we have
within about sixty-eight hours.
In slightly less than three days,
we will not be able to contact
the outside world.
Unfortunately,
both your Seedling boat
and my own homeboat
do not have a traditional radio device.
Sara's homeboat has a radio transceiver,
but it is not portable,
and, as you can see,
we shall jettison that craft
due to its lack of speed.
We lose the only radio transceiver we have
with it.

``We need to utilize the internet connection well,
before our connection is terminated.
For now, I am downloading the English Wikipedia.
Please download as much as you can,
as much information as we can get
that may be useful in the near future.
If there are English Wikipedia articles
you think should be prioritized,
you may coordinate with me using a
parallel download program.
Our most pressing need is to build
a radio transceiver,
but please also consider the other problems we face.

``We are human beings.
We call ourselves @emph{homo sapiens} ---
thinking man.
Without information,
our greatest advantage ---
our brains ---
loses its competitive edge.
We need information
if we are to survive
in these conditions.

``Money is important also due to our food supplies.
We have a little less than
one month's worth of food.
We expected that the Fourth Seedling Company
will be able to purchase food
at our destination.
There are now two problems
with that plan:
Fourth Seedling Company has no liquid assets
to pay for food,
and in wartime,
food often gets rationed
or otherwise limited.
I trust you know enough about free markets
to know what the effect
of limited supply
does to the price.

``We have two main problems to solve:
how to maintain communications with the outside world,
and how to sustain our food supplies.
We have one month of food
but we may need to endure several months
trying to evade enemy military,
and any pirate parasites that arrive
to prey on the weak
in this time of chaos.''

Renee looked directly at the person
who had challenged her.

``As to your families ---
if your family was on R1,
then it seems likely
that they were caught in the explosion
and its side effects.
My condolences to those berieved.
If your family was on R2,
they probably survived.
But as I mentioned,
the United States navy
may target them.
Thus, I suggest that we do not head back.
We expect much fighting in that direction.
It is safer to head to the Polynesian platforms,
and hide among them.
You may need to make a group decision
about whether to head back,
or whether to continue to the Polynesian platforms.

``My condolences to all of you,
citizens of R1 and all the R2's,
for the loss of Rationality One,
and the largest sea platform
of your culture.''

Renee looked at them.

``Finally,'' she said,
``we have a request to make.
Please arrange sleeping shifts
so that, at any moment,
there is at least one person
who is awake and alert.
Someone must have their computation pads enabled,
if we need to contact you in an emergency.
On our side, you can contact my computation pad
and one of us should be able to answer,
whatever time it is.
We ---
Sara, my husband and I ---
have already arranged a sleeping roster
so that at least two of us will be awake
at any time,
and able to answer any local-network
video calls you need.''

Sara was removing
the ladder that connected her boat
to the Seedling's deck.
She pushed it slightly,
letting her boat drift away.

Sara stood there for some time,
watching her boat.
Then she tapped Renee's shoulder
and entered Renee's homeboat.

``Seedlings,
we shall now go north,
to avoid the supertyphoon.
Please coordinate your navigator system
with a flocking program.''

Still, she remained standing
on the Seedling boat's
public-use deck.

Then she said,
``Seedlings, I know that this is a terrible time
for all of you.
Many of you have just lost your families.
And you all face the difficult load
of bearing all that remains
of the culture and customs of R1.
Be strong, my Seedlings.
If you need the help of your Gardeners,
always remember
that it is our duty to help you overcome this problem
and help you grow.''

Then she descended to her boat
and disconnected the ladder.

@node The Admiral
@chapter The Admiral

The Ocean Hunter's prisonboat,
`Error Correction Check,'
drifted somewhere
in the Pacific Ocean.

Laurel Cyrus Blake,
a special guest of the prisonboat,
estimated that they were somewhere
in the tropics,
from the heat and angle of the sun
at midday.

On what had started as an ordinary day,
Laurel awoke early
and performed his usual morning exercise.
By the time his breakfast arrived,
he had worked up an appetite.

After eating,
he asked permission
from the guard
to leave his room.
As a special guest,
he was allowed the run of the prisonboat,
provided an armed guard
escorted him.

As was usual,
he went up onto the prisonboat's private deck.
As was also usual,
the prisonboat's other special guest,
Louisa ex Milan,
was already on deck,
wearing a bikini,
sunbathing on a lounge chair.
Another lounge chair was set up beside her.

Laurel reclined on his lounge chair,
prepared for their usual verbal battle.

``The killjoy arrives,'' said Louisa.
``What shall we debate today?''

``Perhaps the excesses of
anarcho-libertarianism?''

``We had that the other day,''
said Louisa.

``Do you have anything else you'd rather
debate about, @emph{libertine}?''

``Is it not the right ---
excuse me, the @emph{duty} ---
of the man
to make all the decisions, hmm,
@emph{patriarch}?''

``Then do not question my decision.
If you wish to debate
our political philosophies,
then let us focus on
the excesses of
anarcho-libertarianism.''
Laurel sighed loudly,
to broadcast his exasperation.

There was an audience of only two here ---
their two armed guards ---
but Laurel always acted as if
he was speaking publicly.
It was especially ironic,
since the Ocean Hunters
specifically assigned
deaf guards
to escort
the two special guests.
Precautions against subversion.

``As if reactionary, @emph{patriarchal}, conservatism
does not have its excesses,''
said Louisa.
In the beginning of their interment,
such a statement
would have been delivered
with a good dose of contempt.
Poisonous barbs on the weapons
of their verbal conflict.
But as their time in captivity lengthened,
their words and debates
began to take on the tone of a chore,
a charade.
She spoke the words
almost as if she were @emph{bored}.

Even her provocative dress,
or lack thereof,
now seemed ordinary,
no longer shocking.

Something to pass the time,
as they were held,
prisoners of the Ocean Hunters,
never sure of when they would be freed.
Or if they would ever be freed.

``By its definition,
conservatism cannot have any
@emph{excess},''
said Laurel.
``It is conservative.
Cautious.
Measure twice, cut once.''

``In short, a killjoy conservative
in excess
is a Luddite.''

``Not so,''
said Laurel.
``We accept the advance of technology.
We only wish it to be slower,
for human sensibilities
to keep up with it.''
A year ago, perhaps,
he would have offered his defense
much more vehemently.
Long, repetitive debates
on the subject
with this irritating libertine
anarcho-libertarian woman
had ground his passion
into dust.
Even his attack,
when delivered,
sounded half-hearted.
``Whereas your libertine ideology ---
I'm sorry, your @emph{libertarian} ideology ---
follows every new technology eagerly.
It is one of your excesses.
It is no small wonder
that the Atlantic Sea State collapsed,
destroying itself
in a flurry of innovation
before collapsing
from the dangers of its own,
untested, unsafe technological advances.''

``Technological advance cannot be controlled,''
said Louisa.
``You cannot dictate the pace of technology.
You may as well attempt to dictate
the results of a lottery.
You can never be sure
if investigating some phenomenon
will yield a practically useable technology.
It is, in fact, a lottery.''

``We can always choose not to look,''
said Laurel,
``until we have,
mentally and spiritually,
prepared ourselves
for the consequences
of opening the Pandora's box
of technology.''

He looked out,
at the deceptive,
peaceful calm 
of the Pacific Ocean,
waiting for Louisa
to reply.

She sighed.
Or perhaps yawned.

``When will this end?''
she said, finally.

Laurel wondered, too.

He'd been arrested
after making a mistake
that revealed his espionage activities.
He was brought to
`Error Correction Check,'
and introduced to
the stunning Louisa,
who, it turned out,
had also been arrested on espionage charges.

Neither of them revealed
the identities of the groups
or countries
they worked for.
They were kept here,
to be used as potential resources.
Special guests,
separated from the
ordinary prison population,
escorted by armed guards
specifically chosen
for their deafness.

He'd kept to his usual exercise routine
to keep fit,
and,
if he could perhaps
just admit to himself,
to impress Louisa.
He would, of course,
quite adamantly refuse
to have the other special guest
be a better sample of her gender
than he could be of his.
He would be extremely pleased to know
that she would judge him desirable,
if she were to merely look at him,
without listening to his ideology.
After all, if he were honest,
he felt much the same way towards her.
In no way could he allow her
that victory.

The similar charges,
the lack of `special guests'
other than them,
the isolation of their interment,
the unacknowledged
physical attraction to one another,
the long debates ---
the long talks
they would have
almost every day ---
these all brought the two of them
dangerously close together,
even as their
conflicting political ideologies
and their stubborn adherence to those ideologies
strove to keep them apart.

Perhaps if they had known
that it would be their last day
to be with one another,
they might have acted much more differently.

The Pacific Ocean,
its placid surface hiding turmoil,
answered their questions
with its usual silence.

@sp 2

Laurel ignored the rhythmic stepping behind him,
assuming it was simply a patrol.
Only when their guards
suddenly snapped to attention
and saluted
did he look at the source.

He recognized the man.
The man's uniform was emblazoned
with the advertisements
of Ocean Hunters' sponsors.
An honor guard of four
soldiers escorted him.

The man was Admiral Junio ex Legato,
the current admiral of the Ocean Hunters.
He was short and a little fat,
his days in active duty long behind him.

Junio pointed to Louisa,
then flicked his wrist
in some sign
that Laurel couldn't catch.
One of Junio's escorts
separated from the rest
and approached Louisa,
pointing a weapon at her.
Louisa's guard,
and even Laurel's own escort,
approached her,
their weapons drawn
and pointed at Louisa,
surrounding her.

``The individual claiming the name
Louisa ex Milan
is hereby charged of
espionage during wartime,
abetting and aiding hostiles
that threaten the peace
and sovereignty
of all constituents
of the Sea State Agreement,''
said Admiral Junio.
``You shall be escorted to your room,
Louisa ex Milan,
where you will wear decent clothes,
and then escorted
to a different prisonboat,
where you will await the military court
that will convene
to judge your complicity
in last night's
nuclear strike
against the sea platform R1.
Be reminded that,
while espionage outside of wartime
is punishable with
indefinite imprisonment,
espionage @emph{during} wartime
is punishable with
execution.
Spies are @emph{shot} during wartime.''

As Louisa sat, stunned,
Laurel somehow mustered enough
presence of mind
to speak.

``She's been imprisoned here
for at least a year,''
said Laurel.
``How can she have engaged
in espionage?''

``We have evidence pointing to her
as the source of certain classified information
that was leaked to the United States.
Perhaps she has some device hidden somewhere.
We never checked her thoroughly.
Perhaps we should.''
Junio snorted.
``So you defend her now,
Laurel?
I thought you couldn't
tolerate her ideology?''

``You're ---
you're at war
with @emph{the United States of America}?''

``@emph{Yes}.
The most powerful military force
on Earth.''

A host of questions flooded Laurel.
He picked the most important one.

``She's a libertarian.
How could she possibly be working for
the United States?''

``Perhaps she @emph{isn't}
a libertarian.
I admit,
I would have thought it more likely
that you would be the one
who is actually the US of A agent.
Given how powerfully
the Fox News Network
has controlled the country,
a conservative like you
would be exactly what we expect
a United States spy to be.
But we have compelling evidence
that it was actually her,
and we have evidence
that you haven't done any espionage
since your arrest.''

``She's already a prisoner here,''
said Laurel.
``She isn't going anywhere.
She's already under arrest.''

``We've decided to move her from here.
Since she appears to have some way
of communicating to others
even though she has been imprisoned here,
she may have some way
of escaping from this prisonboat.''
Admiral Junio sneered at him.
``Why this uncharacteristic change,
conservative?
Why defend this avowed arch-enemy of yours?
Have you fallen in love with her?''

Louisa stood up,
her knees shaking.

Their eyes met for a brief second.

``I only want justice to be done properly,''
said Laurel, looking back at Junio,
daring the admiral to contradict him.
``I cannot possibly love her,
her ideology is a dark subversion,
a twisting of my own pure ideology.''

For some reason, after saying this,
he looked down at his feet,
feeling horrified at what he'd just said,
even though it was perfectly correct and right.

He heard footsteps receding away from him,
and for some reason a deep pain
gripped his heart.

``As for you,
Laurel Cyrus Blake,
you shall come with me,''
said Junio.

``Where?''
said Laurel.
Hostility burned at the edge of his voice.
He knew it was dangerous
to be too overtly hostile
to the admiral
that held him captive,
but for some reason,
he didn't feel a pressing need to care
about consequences.

``To my flagship.
You are a potential military target.
This is largely a civilian prisonboat.
Hopefully, if you're not here,
even if this prisonboat is captured
by the United States navy
they will be compelled to be lenient,
given that all the prisoners
are all noncombatant civilians,
anyway.
Maybe.''

They walked,
escorted by the three remaining soldiers
of Admiral Junio ex Legato.
On the side of the boat
opposite where
Laurel and Louisa habitually
had their long debates
was docked a warship.

An @emph{old} warship.

``That's your flagship?
The United States can probably take that down
using one remote drone.''

``That,'' said Junio,
``is not my flagship.
Louisa will be taken there
for her trial,
and will probably be executed there.
We wait here.''

When Junio's flagship did arrive,
Laurel looked up and gaped at it in awe.

@sp 2

The airship dropped a length of rope.
One of Junio's escorts
scrambled after it,
tying it to the prisonboat's deck.
More ropes dropped down,
to be secured on the deck.

``How...?'' said Laurel.

Admiral Junio ex Legato just pointed
at an advertisement on his uniform.

An advertisement for Blimp Tourism.

``Only the best possible ship
for the flagship, right?''
said Junio.

``I don't see how it's going to be better
than that warship.''

``Airships are surprisingly powerful
in combat.
The airbag is not going to appear on radar,
giving us a tremendous stealth advantage.
The gondola of that airship
is assembled from
3-D printed parts ---
it's plastic, also not very reflective to radar.
It means that most missiles
will be unable to get a lock on it,
only guns will be able to target it.
The gondola isn't armored
but it doesn't have to be ---
its position makes it difficult
to target from air-to-air
using just guns.
Hitting the airbag won't crash
the airship ---
there are several internal ballonets
that are unconnected,
and all have to be destroyed
to crash the airship.
Each ballonet has self-healing resin
to protect against most punctures.
It needs no fuel,
as its engines are all electric
and fed from the solar panels.
The only supplies it needs are
food and water for
the squishy humans on board,
replacement helium for what little it leaks,
and relatively simple explosive bombs,
which, as military equipment goes,
are cheap.
That airship is specifically designed
for high altitudes.
At its
cruise altitude eighteen thousand meters
above sea level,
its radar can reach more than
four hundred eighty kilometers,
and only specially-designed military airplanes
can engage it.
We can also avoid most surface-to-air
guns by keeping out of their range,
and with luck we can sneak on top
of an unsuspecting fixed target
under cloud or night cover
and bomb it.

``I've got a ship that can spot enemies
from very far away,
is itself very hard to spot,
is surprisingly tough,
operates at the edge
of the engagement range
of other aircraft
and well out of range of all seacraft,
and can destroy any fixed target
with cooperative weather
and using relatively cheap ammunition.''

The airship descended,
pulling on the ropes
tied to the prisonboat.

``If you can use an airship,''
said Laurel,
``the Americans can use them too.''

``They already do,'' said Junio.
``They use airships as scouts
and command centers already.
Airships are too slow
to hunt down mobile targets,
so they haven't bothered to
weaponize them.
I realized, however,
that airships are quite fine
against fixed targets.
And Sea State has the advantage
that we @emph{don't} have any 
fixed targets.
Our land-based opponents do.''

Junio smiled at him.

``Come on,'' he said.
``You're my special guest
in the safest place
on Sea State.''

@node The Seedlings Reconsider
@chapter The Seedlings Reconsider

Marco was not able to sleep.
Few of the Seedlings could.

Marco lay in his bunk,
thoughts jumbled.

Damian sat in his bunk.
His hands were on
his customized keyboard,
but he was just staring at the pad.
The usual quiet tapping of keys
was missing.

Cheers had decided to help
organize the sleep roster
so that at least two Seedlings
would be awake,
the contact point in case of emergency.
He had volunteered to be one
of the first to man the communications.

Marco didn't know where John was,
but he suspected that John
was in the 3-D Printer room.

Marco closed his eyes,
in order to organize his thoughts.

@sp 2

What do you want?
What do you have?
How can you use the latter
to gain the former?

Marco wanted his family.

He had a physical bitcoin,
the standard items issued
with his knapsack,
a small community of
similarly shocked teenagers,
two Gardeners,
an internet connection
that would disappear
in a few days...

There was no way to get
his family back.

If your goals are not feasible,
try dividing them
into smaller parts,
and see if the smaller parts
are individually feasible.

Yes, he wanted his family.
